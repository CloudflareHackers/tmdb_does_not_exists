  "overview": "The web-cam industry is now at its peak in Russia, thousands of ex-schoolchildren work from their homes or at private studios, selling solo or even group sex for money to anonymous customers online. Tanya and Vova are young and wild; they have easy money, sex, drugs, and freedom. They don’t give a damn about anyone judging them, or about taboos. The web-cam seems to give them everything, but also takes away important things. When real feelings enter their working relations, everything starts falling apart.",
