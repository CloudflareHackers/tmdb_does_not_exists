But can these meek freaks go from geek to Greek in just one week?  Find out as these coed cutie pies copulate their way across their college campus with a course curriculum ranging from Bikini Car Wash 101 to Advanced Exotic Dance, and see just what it takes (and what they have to shake) to make it as a pledge at the Bikini Sorority House.",
