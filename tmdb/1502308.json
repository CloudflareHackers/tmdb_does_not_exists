  "overview": "Set in the late 1960s, this story combines three chilling tales inspired by Tagore's Monihara, Bibhutibhushan's Taranath Tantrik, and Manoj Sen's Shikar.  On a stormy evening, two strangers arrive at Bibhutibhushan's ancestral home. As rain pours outside, the men exchange mysterious stories of a greedy womans spirit bound to her jewels, a mystic caught between power and peace, and a conman whose perfect crime takes a dark turn.  As dawn breaks, a deeper connection between the storytellers is revealed, one that binds their fates forever.",
