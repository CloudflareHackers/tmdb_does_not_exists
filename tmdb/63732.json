  "overview": "American folklore goes nutty and smutty with Frankie and Johnnie... Were Lovers, and, \"Oh Lordy, how they could love!\" Especially since Frankie is played by everyone's favorite pouty-cheeked sex starlet, RENE BOND, and Johnnie is her frequent co-star and then-paramour, RIC LUTZE. As the trailer proclaims, \"Lovers in real life, they give the performances of their careers!\"",
