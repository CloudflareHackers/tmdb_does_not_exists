  "overview": "In Silk [James Herbert] films a man and a woman, exploding the quality of silk out of the house into the back yard, where everything becomes a sheen of texture. It too has great sensuosity, but itâ€™s like tearing silk, like being up against silk, your face wrapped in it as you watch the screen. (Stan Brakhage)",
