But Haruka accidentally missed the power selection period, and now he's stuck with the leftover abilities his classmates refused to take! Seemingly underpowered, he makes use of his unwanted skills to live a (surprisingly comfortable) life as a lone wolf...but his classmates soon learn their \"superior\" abilities aren't as great as they're cracked up to be, and Haruka may have to come to their rescue using ingenuity, creativity, and the leftover powers his classmates once snubbed.",
