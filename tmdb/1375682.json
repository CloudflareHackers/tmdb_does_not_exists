  "overview": "Umbro, the threshold of a home, is the liminal space that speaks to the lives of women, including the filmmaker's mother and her friends who live in the small town of Dhrangadhra in Gujarat, India. The film explores joyful friendships among women, often dismissed and unsung - carrying in them moments of shared stories, solidarities, conflicts and, most of all, routine acts of resistance.",
