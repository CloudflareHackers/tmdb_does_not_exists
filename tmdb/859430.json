  "overview": "This movie was to be as absurd as Antfarm Dickhole, but Bill Zebubâ€™s research inspired new story ideas. This will still be an unusual tale, but it will be a bit deeper than planned. Then again, Bill Zebub usually adds deeper levels for those who want to explore.  It might be safe to call this a spoof of occult horror. That was the original idea. It is more than a parody however.",
