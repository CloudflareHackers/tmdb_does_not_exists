  "overview": "In the run-up to the 2006 winter Olympics, the BBC decided to bring together their sports team and the people who brought us Walking with Dinosaurs with the wildlife documentary division to give us this weirdly compelling one-off special that looks like it should be absurd but surprisingly works on several levels. Opening with an owl carrying a frozen Olympic torch, we are treated to events such as speed skating, ski jump, cross country, cold endurance and others between the teams representing birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and humans.",
