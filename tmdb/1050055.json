Embarrassed by her mom's lustful behavior, Katie rushes off with her boyfriend for some privacy and sanity. Katie's friends don't see why Katie's embarrassed; they find her mom a wealth of sexual wisdom and relationship advice. It's not until Katie decides to be a bit more sexually open-minded herself that she realizes how much her mom really means to her.",
