  "overview": "An older adolescent girl has a number of sexual adventures in France, then moves on to Montreal and New York, there finding erotic pleasure, love and danger. Flashbacks place our heroine at approximately eight years of age and perhaps suggest that her promiscuous nature has been inspired by her father's incestuous advances towards her.",
