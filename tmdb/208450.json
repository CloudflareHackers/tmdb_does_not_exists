  "overview": "Structured as a complete production diary of the 42-day shooting schedule, this supplement can be played in its entirety or easily broken down over the course of multiple nights. In essence, this fascinating behind the scenes supplement displays on-set footage of the cast and crew while Stallone provides an enlightening after-the-fact commentary track. If you ever thought Stallone was simply a knucklehead action star with big muscles, this should completely change your opinion.",
