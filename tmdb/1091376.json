  "overview": "Samson Nazirite (Herschel Savage) always focused on creating \"the good life.\" By the age of 37, Samson attained the three things he'd most desired: status, money and, more importantly, power. When neglected girlfriend, Christy leaves him, he's to question what \"the good life\" is without having someone to share it with. But, when Samson meets Delilah (Jessica Drake), a stunning hairdresser, the attraction is immediate. Like him, Delilah is headstrong, ambitious and, most importantly, drop dead gorgeous. Amidst repeated warnings from his mother and friends, Samson quickly falls for Delilah and, just as quickly . . . loses it all.",
