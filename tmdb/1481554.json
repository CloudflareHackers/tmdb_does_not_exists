  "overview": "23 (Iravai Moodu) is a hard-hitting social drama that interweaves three gripping narratives inspired by real-life tragedies: the 1991 Tsunduru massacre, the 1993 Chilakaluripeta bus burning incident, and the 1997 Hyderabad car bomb blast.  Bold, unflinching, and deeply thought-provoking, 23 serves as a powerful outcry for dignity, justice, and societal reform.",
