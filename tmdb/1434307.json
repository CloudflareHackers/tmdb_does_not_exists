That is how he is confused and with his ideals and morality he is living outside his own time and inevitably suffering. His self criticism is endless. He dreams about whatever he lacks and about his ideals. The dreams have led him to the domain of non-communication. His repressed passion along with his self criticism has made him bored with life. Now at every point he expects something exceptional.",
