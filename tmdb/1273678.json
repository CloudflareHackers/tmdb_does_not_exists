  "overview": "A woman in common, a daughter in half and a patrol car for two. Antonio and Pieraldo share many things: a less-than-brilliant career, a less-than-ideal partnership, a long-term but slightly bruised bond -- two lives apparently too quiet for two police officers that fate has cleverly wanted to intertwine. Danger was definitely not their profession... until, incredibly, they will have to face a real crime, a very intricate and risky case that, between challenges against time and twists, will change their lives forever.",
