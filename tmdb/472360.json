  "overview": "For her epic exploration of the female orgasm, Catalan artist Mireia Sallares interviewed 30 Mexican women from various walks of life: professors, prostitutes, psychologists, nuns, revolutionaries, and former child brides. Her interviews go beyond the “little deaths” of the title, seamlessly moving between issues of sexual violence, political protest, love, family, and mortality. In a culture where sexual taboos run deep, what the women of Little Deaths have in common is a belief in liberation and self-discovery through sexuality, and a remarkable courage in the face of tragedy and oppression.",
