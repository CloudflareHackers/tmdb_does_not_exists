  "overview": "There is a place where hotties roam free as the wind, uninhibited and unbound by societal conventions like chastity and shame. In a secluded mountain valley, a hotbed of paranormal activity the locals took to calling \"Ghost Gulch\", stands a ramshackle country brothel. Here working girls ply their trade, servicing the lonely mountain men, and all is right in the world. Until one fateful day, when the hotties' fertile cleft (of land) attracts the attention of greedy politicians, gangsters, and corrupt cops, who tighten their stranglehold on the placid mountain nymphs until they finally squeeze too hard - and the nymphs fight back.",
