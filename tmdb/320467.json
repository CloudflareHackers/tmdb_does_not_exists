  "overview": "In a Relationship is a spirited yet achingly tender look at modern love. Shot mockumentary style, this short film follows two young couples in opposite stages of romance: Matt and Willa, who have been hooking up for six days, and Owen and Abby, who are trying in vain to breathe new life into a five year relationship that is growing stale. It's an exploration of the grey areas of contemporary dating and how much we keep from the people we're closest to.",
