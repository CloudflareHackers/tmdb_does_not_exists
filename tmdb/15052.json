It appears that the murderer's grisly methods are identical to that of London's infamous 19th century psychopath Jack the Ripper â€“ a relentless serial killer who was never caught by police. To make matters worse, the detective soon notices the parallels between the crimes committed by the West Hollywood stalker and those of a serial murderer incarcerated years ago. Could the wrong man be behind bars?",
