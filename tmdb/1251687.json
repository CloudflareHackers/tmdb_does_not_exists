  "overview": "Seventeen year old Tanya's plans for a carefree summer are derailed when her stressed-to-the-limit mom takes off for a wellness retreat and puts Tanya and her three siblings in the charge of a crotchety (and racist) old babysitter. The babysitterâ€™s sudden death leaves the kids short on cash and reluctant to pull mom prematurely out of her much-needed R&R, so Tanya is forced to get a job. Posing as an adult, she gets a gig as the executive assistant at a fashion company and overnight is thrust into the world of adulthood and parenting.",
