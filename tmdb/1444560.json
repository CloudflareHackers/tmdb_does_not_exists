As a consequence, the victim's action and reaction is programmed and they are performed mechanically as a ritual. In this film, a family of three falls victim to a middle-aged officer, who controls their lives. The woman is thrown in prison, the man becomes a toy in the hands of the officer and their child looks on innocently.",
