  "overview": "Several couples demonstrate 50 positions of lovemaking from the Kama Sutra while an off-screen narrator, a woman with a soft voice, describes each position, provides its name, and notes its pleasures, sensations, intensities, originality, and caveats. The primary set is a large bedroom, with the bed in the center; the walls are yellow, the lighting soft; mirrors sometimes provide additional angles. Music plays. The silent couples move rhythmically and keep their cool.",
