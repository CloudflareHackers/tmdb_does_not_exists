  "overview": "With humour, absurdity and family cat and mouse at its center, this is a tale of family gangsters in a fictitious madhouse city, Bindiya. As the current Don is put behind bars, the gangster family's alliances shift, new love, friendships, and betrayals explode until Bindiya becomes a full-blown circus-where love is a deal, power is personal, and every one has a card and blood on their hands.",
