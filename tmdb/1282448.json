Rini, a first-year student at SMA Pandega, participated in a camp in the Wana Alus forest to prove her strength and get closer to Miko, the head of the committee whom she secretly admired. Although initially prohibited by the village guardian, Mbah Sonto, permission was finally granted on the condition of not disturbing the sacred place. However, during the three days of the camp, inexplicable events occurred. On the night of the peak performance of the drama, Rini, who played the role of Roro Putri, suddenly became possessed by the spirit of the original Roro Putri and triggered a mass possession among the other participants. Chaos ensued, with many victims being injured and some in life-threatening situations. Miko, the troop leader, and Mbah Sonto fought hard to save the students. Can they overcome this supernatural terror and bring all the participants home safely?",
