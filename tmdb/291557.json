However, Detective Sandra Franks, Nickie's lover, believes James is a fake and that her girlfriend is in over her head. James has problems of his own. Troubled by a sleep disorder, he checks himself into a hospital where he meets an oversexed nurse who will become the next victim of these mysterious crimes.
