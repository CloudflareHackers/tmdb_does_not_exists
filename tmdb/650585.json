  "overview": "Until recent years, the Santhali tribe of India did not have its own written language. Their stories and myths were preserved and passed on verbally through the generations. Each narration has a different form, much like the rocks of a nearby hill that come in various hues. While a woman from the community narrates a tale about the origin of creation and how their first house was built, the village prepares for an annual ritual.",
