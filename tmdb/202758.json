  "overview": "Love is pure and eternal, but not all stories of romance are smooth, especially those that come with their share of suspicious glares and are often turned into juicy gossip. Dhappa is a collection of five such stories of romance. Whether it is a couple struggling to buy contraceptives in a town where everyone knows everyone,  a professor being friends with her young student, a bride-to-be who conceives a little earlier, than expected, or two friends who are being forced by their families to tie the knot, a sudden funeral disturbing the plan of a couple planning to enjoy their wedding night before the actual night, these couples try their best to save their relationship from the prying eyes of their relatives and neighbors. Only time will tell if they will succeed, or not.",
