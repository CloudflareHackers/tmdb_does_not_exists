  "overview": "Middle-aged Hiroshi, a 53‑year‑old salaryman whose wife cheats on him and whose daughter barely tolerates him, finds himself discarded by his company and adrift—until a mysterious phone call from Mariko, his long‑lost love who supposedly died thirty years ago, pulls him into a forbidden reverie and dreams of a different life with her. Mariko, embodied by the irresistible Yōko Satomi—dressed in the provocative uniforms and iconic emblems of the old protest movements—the past awakens in tantalizing detail. As Hiroshi dials into a life he might have lived with Mariko, full of erotic promise and the intoxicating thrill of rewriting his destiny.",
