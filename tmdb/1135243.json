But it is already too late: when the cocaine-addicted blonde kidnaps a policeman and falls in love with him, she ends up in the rehab clinic of a perverted doctor. In addition, she finally has the criminal underworld at the lightly dressed butt cheek. In a love and drug frenzy, sexy Alina wreaks havoc on friend and foe alike.",
