The foursome get together and arrange the fake kidnapping of the sisters so as to extort a large sum of money from Vidrohi. Things go completely out of control and awry, when Vikas and Sunil find out that the kidnapping has taken place - not by them - but by notorious international terrorist and seemingly invincible Colonel Chikara.",
