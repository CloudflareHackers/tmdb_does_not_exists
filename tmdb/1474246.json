  "overview": "Krishna Arjun is Hemwant Tiwari’s second ambitious single-shot film, a gripping tale of brotherhood, betrayal, and redemption set in rural India.  After years of estrangement, Krishna returns to his native village determined to set things right. Haunted by the past and driven by a sense of responsibility, he seeks to reconnect with his innocent twin brother, Arjun. Unbeknownst to Krishna, Arjun has become an unwitting pawn in a dangerous political conspiracy, orchestrated by a corrupt local minister.  As events unfold in real time, captured in a seamless single take, Krishna races against time to uncover the truth and protect his brother before it's too late. Tensions rise, loyalties are tested, and hidden motives come to light in this powerful and immersive cinematic experience.  Krishna Arjun explores the strength of familial bonds in the face of manipulation and moral decay — all through the lens of a technically bold and emotionally charged narrative.",
