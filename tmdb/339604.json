  "overview": "Candy is having a bad day. During a morning bike ride, she crosses paths with a truck and the truck wins. Her untimely demise lands her in a strange place... Is it Heaven? Is it Hell? Its neither... Candy finds herself in limbo, forced to take a number to find out if she's going up to the pearly gates or heading down to the depths of hell. Along the way, she has a chance meeting with an ex-boyfriend and they pass the time reminiscing about better days and better lays. She hears many odd stories of how people ended up in this sort of purgatory. And as she finds out, it seems that as on Earth, everyone loves a good sex story!",
