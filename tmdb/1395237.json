  "overview": "The sexy and charming counselor, So-yeon, encounters patients with stimulating (and sometimes humorous) episodes! Plus, the surprising secret she harbors! Many patients come to see her with different stories, which include a couple struggling with their sexless relationship, the poignant tale of a man fired from his job due to his foot fetish, and the heartbreaking story of a female client who can no longer engage in intimacy after being harshly rejected by her once-beloved partner. So-yeon provides each of them with unique and tailored prescriptions. Additionally, there is a man who has fallen in love with his sister-in-law, but he finds himself desiring her even more instead of being cured after seeking counseling.",
