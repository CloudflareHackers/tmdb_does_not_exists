  "overview": "Four different Alices wander through mazes constructed from 40 years of Spanish history in this post-Franco meditation. Loosely related to the \"Alice\" of Alice in Wonderland, in one episode of this film, Alice (who is clearly a metaphor for the Spanish people) is raped by some multinational corporations. Told in a somewhat confusing manner, especially for those unfamiliar with the nuances of Spain's history in the period between 1936 and 1975, this is director Jorge Feliu's first feature film.",
