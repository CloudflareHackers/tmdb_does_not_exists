  "overview": "Julie Meadows and Randy Spears star as slightly old-fashioned offbeat newlywed couple whose honeymoon gets off to a shaky start when their car breaks down on a lonely highway. Strange sexual events begin to unfold soon after the couple takes shelter in a surreal deserted mansion that seems to have a life of its own. It's not long before they realize that this is no ordinary estate, but the legendary--and presumably defunct--hedonist resort known as Sex World! As the guests of the bizarre and reclusive Dr. Wolfe and his \"Family\" of lifelike erotic robots, the newlyweds find their marriage put to the test as their most personal and hidden fantasies are brought to life over the course of a single night that they-nor you- will ever forget! By morning they've survived a veritable pornucopia of perversions--only to discover the shocking truth about Sex World!",
