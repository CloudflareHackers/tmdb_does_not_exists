  "overview": "There's a special place in Georgia called Two Moon Junction. It's known for its power of seduction and for awakening the sense with an unquenchable sexual passion. It's no wonder overworked supermodel Savannah Delongpre longs to retun to her home town. She's at the height of her success, with fame, fortune, and everything the fast lane has to offer, including a lover who's sleeping with her best friend. Disillusioned with the high life, Savannah retreats to the estate of her grandmother, and the sanctuary of the family's riverfront hideaway - Two Moon Junction. There, Savannah meets her match, a handsome local sculptor named Jake GIlbert who unleashes her passion. However, Jake and Savannah's future is marred by the past. Her torrid affair is further complicated by her manipulative boyfriend who tries to seduce her back to New York. Savannah has to choose between all that Two Moon Junction can offer and her body and soul, and the rich and glamorous New York life she left behind.",
