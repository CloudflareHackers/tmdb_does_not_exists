  "overview": "Through the discerning lens of a Bahujan feminist filmmaker operating within the upper-caste Indian film industry, the film delves deep into critical themes of liberty, equality, fraternity, social justice, exclusion, and marginalised representation. Bridging the realms of Ambedkarite politics with the visual language of cinema, it offers a poignant representation of the culture, history, and politics of marginalised communities within popular cinema and media. A cinematic embodiment of Dr. B.R. Ambedkarâ€™s philosophical legacy, as it questions the deeply rooted institution of caste in India, the film becomes a powerful commentary on religion, revolution, politics, and the fundamental right to freedom of speech.",
