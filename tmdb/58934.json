  "overview": "Bani – Ishq Da Kalma is an Indian television drama series, which premiered on March 18, 2013 on Colors. The series was originally titled Gurbani, which means the composition of the Sikh Gurus. The title of the series was changed after several concerns reported by Sikh organizations, including Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. The team completed 100 episodes on 2 August 2013.\n\nThe story is set against the background of Punjab, and revolves round Bani, a young woman whose life is ruled by her mother's ambitions. The mother, Desho, dreams of getting Bani married to an expatriate or Non Resident Indian man. For twenty two years there has been a division in Bani's family—between her father Sarabjit and his brother Nirvail. Despite this, Bani and Nirvail's daughter Rajji are the best of friends. Bani, though she respects Desho's wishes, is not too keen to marry an NRI. Rajji is aware of this.",
