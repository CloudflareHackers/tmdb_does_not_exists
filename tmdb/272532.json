Stuck in a deserted cavern, cut off from Kord, Pronto and the rest of their arsenal by a rockslide, Eli and Trixie find themselves outmatched and unable to hold off villains Locke and Lode and their deadly gattler blaster and ghouls. With only a few slugs at hand, Eli and Trixie will have to outwit and outrun the twins in a race to meet the other Shane Gang members and the rest of their slugs at the cavern entrance on the other side. But everything changes when the team meet UNI while hiding out in some old transport tunnels.  Though they mistake him for a flopper at first, they quickly discover this isn’t any ordinary flopper – it’s the legendary universal slug!",
