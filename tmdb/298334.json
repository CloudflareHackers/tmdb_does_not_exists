  "overview": "Presented here are three \"untold stories\" from the classic Chinese Novel: Water Margin:  \"Jinx\": Madam Sun is a woman who always thirsts for sex. However, her husband Cheung Ching is impotent, yet clever enough in developing a drug that can heal his shortcoming;  \"Prodigal\": Yin Ching is a martial arts master who knows how to achieve victory with each part of his body, except for his most private part, until a prostitute teaches him a most important good lesson;  \"Black Whirlwind\": Li Kwai is thwarted by his own fame. Faked whirlwinds are everywhere looking to take advantage. A lustful girl is wise and fortunate enough to play dirty, with both impostors, as well as our genuine hero.",
