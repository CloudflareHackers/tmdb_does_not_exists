  "overview": "Affective Dynamics Study Group is a collective devoted to 'study' in the Motenian sense, examining issues around interpersonal relations, non-violent communication, vulnerability, complicity and new ways of being and living together. Part consciousness-raising experiential group, part never-ending rehearsal, the collective meets to perform a series of experimental exercises together, borrowed from the fields of somatics, group therapy, activism, and movement practices.",
