  "overview": "The ‘OstWest TV’ team broadcasts from exile in Berlin for a Russian-speaking audience. It is one of the last independent voices in Russian; its programmes and reports analyse Kremlin propaganda.  More than 1,000 kilometres away, the journalists of the Ukrainian investigative editorial team ‘Schemesa’ of ‘Radio Free Europe’ have been reporting on the war in their homeland for almost three years - a war they are experiencing themselves day by day.  The film team accompanies reporters from both newsrooms between rocket fire and the Munich Security Conference, while researching war crimes, the death of Alexei Navalny and analysing war propaganda. ‘With facts against Putin's propaganda’ shows how important fact-based journalism is.",
