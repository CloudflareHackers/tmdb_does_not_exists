  "overview": "The film starts with Kailasam (Ravi Kale), the somber bigwig is performing the last rites of some one dear to himâ€”but the appearance of Kottai (Jeeva), first in the chaotic Koovagam festival and later atop a Veeranam pipe, swinging a scythe maniacally sets the tone for the rest of the film. Cut to the flashback a few months ago:In madurai, where Kottai's mother (Saranya Ponvannan) is cutting down logs, and boasting about her son: he's a god who deserves to see the outside world and derive its benefits.",
