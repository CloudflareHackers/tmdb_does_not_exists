  "overview": "India is the largest democracy in the world. In Delhi, the capital, there is a street set aside for permanent protests - Parliament Street. People converge daily to make all sorts of grand demands. Among the crowds three blind men come across an elephant. While the crowds surge and shout their demands, the men try to decide what the elephant is. They each experience something different. This film provides a simple illustration of our ability to agree on our diversity in the chaos that surrounds us.",
