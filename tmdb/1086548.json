  "overview": "17-year-old Vera divides her days between volleyball and school and has a good time with friends like an average teenager. She appears to be a perfect daughter who never gets into trouble. But she has a secret hobby: she anonymously rents out an empty apartment to teenagers looking for a place to have sex. She steals the keys from her distracted mother (who manages different properties) and organizes everything. The teenagers come and go, using the apartment for a few uninterrupted hours making Vera the saviour of all their needs. With that she unlocks a new world for herself – playing invisible, Vera stays behind the closed door; her own sexual desires unfolding as she listens to other people’s pleasure.",
