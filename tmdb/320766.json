  "overview": "Combining rare archival footage and in-depth interviews with fans and fellow musicians, this documentary provides fascinating insight into the highs and lows of the infamous Sex Pistols -- the nihilistic British rockers who changed the face of rock 'n' roll with their raw sound and refusal to comply. A punked-out soundtrack includes \"Anarchy in the UK,\" \"God Save the Queen,\" \"Pretty Vacant\" and \"Holidays in the Sun.\"",
