However, he is accidentally killed by Ravi in a scuffle. Sasi soon finds out that the real culprit is Ravi. Infuriated, she breaks up with him. Ravi, unable to bear the rejection, jumps from a hill. He escapes death, only to be told by the doctors that he is disabled and might be cured in the future if someone took care of him. In the climax, Sasi decides to stay with Ravi, who is nothing but a vegetable now, stating that what ever he did was just because of his love for her and she still is in love with him.
