  "overview": "In this sexy spin-off of the Hollywood classic \"Sunset Boulevard\", Ginger Lynn plays Katherine, a writer who recounts the bizarre circumstances surrounding her death. When her career hit a dead end, Katherine found herself on the doorstep of Rocklyn Davis (Jamie Gillis) an aging porn star who took her in and promised her shelter with a safe creative environment. Where she had really landed was in a house rife with sexual tension, erotic mystery and romantic betrayal. In this case, truth was definitely stranger than fiction.",
