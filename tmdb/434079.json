  "overview": "The grandchildren from Prague come to visit their colorful Wallachian grandfather for the holidays. Their busy parents send them with the good intention of changing their virtual world of the internet, cell phones, and tablets. In the Wallachian village, everything works a little differently. It's not that there's no signal, but the Wallachians simply live a little differently, in their own way. What's more, if you find a forgotten treasure in your grandfather's attic that catches the interest of the rest of the village, you'll suddenly have a ticket to a mysterious excursion through the history of old Wallachia from spring to winter.",
