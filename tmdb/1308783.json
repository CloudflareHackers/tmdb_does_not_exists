  "overview": "Coldplay were the Saturday night headliner at the 2024 Glastonbury Festival. The band is no stranger to the Pyramid Stage top spot. In 2002, they headlined for the first time, with just one album under their belt. Fast-forward 22 years, they’re nine albums deep, and it’s the fifth time these Worthy Farm favourites have topped the bill, making them the only act to have ever reached this milestone. They are a band who are continually pushing their live show to new levels, so expect a visual spectacle and to be singing at the top of your voice to a set list full of bangers!",
