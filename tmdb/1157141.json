  "overview": "This thoughtful, often fascinating featurette focuses on the psychiatric aspects of \"Shutter Island\" and how consultant James Gilligan counseled the actors so they could better understand their reactions and motivations. We also learn about the controversial yet prevalent practice of lobotomizing violent mental patients and how the more humane approach of pharma-psychology gradually replaced it around the time period in which the story takes place.",
