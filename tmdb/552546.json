The building is home to a wide cross-section of folks, from a college Professor of Sexology to a former showgirl to a shy computer genius. The one thing they all have in common is a taste for wild sexual antics. While the Professor is busy 'tutoring' a couple of students in the art of Sapphic sex, the actress is experiencing her first taste of the Casting Couch. Meanwhile, a couple of buddies swap dates and find their true matches -- or at least their matches for the night! It's non-stop action as the Sexual Revolution is blown wide open in scene after scene of utter carnal pleasure.\"",
