  "overview": "The film starts with the story of the younger Bala Krishna (Srimannarayana) working as a college professor. As usual the best looking girl of the college (Janaki played by Sneha Ullal) falls in love with Srimannarayana (the monkish protector of justice); reasons for that are comprehendible only by someone who had seen enough Telugu films (Bala Krishna films in particular). As the first half progresses the screenplay tells us that Janaki’s and Srimmanarayna’s pasts are related and the flashback starts occupying the screen. The daddy Bala Krishna with Nayanatara next to him and Kota Srinivas Rao playing the bad guy in a war between good and evil about the welfare of the region is the film’s flashback",
