  "overview": "What could be lovelier than Women's Lake - a magical summer setting near Berlin?  Rosa, perhaps. She's the slightly melancholy guardian of the lake, spending her days in a boat, trapping fish and watching for poachers. Or her lover, the polished and prosperous Kirsten, with her perfect cottage on the shore of Frauensee.  How does their relationship work, and what effect will the two young lesbians in the canoe have on it all?  Thoughtful, complex and beautiful.",
