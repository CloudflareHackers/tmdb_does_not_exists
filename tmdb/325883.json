  "overview": "Shavala is a smart, urbane young anthropologist who seeks the help of an acquaintance, Sandesh, a young Fine Arts student to work as her guide while researching the sexual customs of the Pari Tribe in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra in India. Her beautiful, almost bewitching journey to this secluded ancient village 'Pareni Tree' becomes a journey of horror as she is unwittingly trapped in a sexual encounter with far reaching repercussions. The film questions our deep rooted sexual emotions, customs and practices and their expression in today's age of hyper technology and pornography.",
