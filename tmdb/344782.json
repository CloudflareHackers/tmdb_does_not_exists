The geishas at the inn have their hands full as the inn is fully booked. A shrewd rich tycoon makes an offer to the owner to buy the inn. But she dismisses his offer and names a much higher price. The tycoon is reluctant until news that some actual gold pieces have been unearthed. But is the timing of this “news” a little too convenient?",
