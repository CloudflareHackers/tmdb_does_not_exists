  "overview": "At least 10 known health benefits of 'Gulkand' (Rose-Petal Jam). This film is about the 11th and perhaps the most important benefit - Happinessâ€”a film as sweet, fragrant and healthy as the condiment itself. Nostalgia re-creates relationship drama like no other emotion. When young lovers unite - the whole world conspires to challenge them at every step...but what happens when 'older lovers' re-unite? Gulkand is one such rosy sweet story that celebrates the innocence; the high-strung emotions; the melodrama; the sweetness and the tragic-comedy nature of the perpetual global pandemic - love.",
