  "overview": "Deep in the night, eight machines draw shapes into the soft ground, patterns and designs. Illuminated only by their own lights, they move in conjunction, at times as pairs, then in long lines, forming circles, figures of eight, loops. Based on traditional, regional alpine folkdances, the choreography presents the machines as both cumbersome and agile, creating a luminous dance inscribed in the snow.",
