  "overview": "'Baagh' explores the relevance of our wild animal instincts in a civilized society through the eyes of a folk actor who performs as the tiger for a living. Citizen advises the King to interview a tiger to know more. Mr. Jaiswal, the Goat, helmed in-charge of the project. Grand arrangements were planned but later the King orders Citizen to cut down the expense. Disappointed by the Tiger's meek responses the Goat resorts to torturous conduct and what follows from here is absolute mayhem.",
