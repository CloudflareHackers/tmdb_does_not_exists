  "overview": "disobedience is the visually lush journey of a mother on the lam. Warned by her three-year old son to \"never go down to the end of the town\", she nonetheless ventures far beyond the confines of home, heterosexuality, and the physical world. In punishment for her infatuation with an operatic Valkyrie, she is arrested, interned, stolen by pirates, and x-rayed by a book-eating bull-dyke. She loses her eye (and her way home), but in the end receives the gift of self.",
