One day she is attacked by two delinquent girls. Muraki, a teacher with a weak heart, sees this and scares them off. Namiâ€™s bizarre hallucinations now begin to feature Muraki abusing her in various S&M situations. Two years later Nami, a college student, meets Muraki on the street and invites him for a drink. He gets drunk and passes out. When he wakes up he finds himself in a S&M themed hotel room where Nami waits to fulfill her desire to be dominated and abused by the man of her dreams.",
