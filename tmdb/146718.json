At the trains station she meets a would-be cinematographer who is color blind. They become friends sharing their dreams of going to Hollywood. One day she finds a goldfish trapped in a beer bottle: she sets her free and makes three wishes, not for herself but for her friends. To her surprise all of them come true.
