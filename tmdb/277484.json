  "overview": "French filmmakers Cedric Laty and Vincent Gerard chronicle the life of lensman William Eggleston, emerging with an artful documentary as much about the man as it is about the everyday places in the American South that he encapsulates, and transforms, in his work. Considered a pioneer of color photography, Eggleston is known for seeing the beautiful in the mundane, and the film captures the essence of his vision.",
