  "overview": "One of Morrisroe’s three surviving films (a fourth, centered on the murder of his cat, was censored immediately after it was shown, and has been lost) that all engage with the experimental cinematic language of their time, incorporating elements of horror cinema, a punk ethos, and the outrageousness of artists like Jack Smith, Kenneth Anger, and John Waters. Much like the early screenings of Nan Goldin’s BALLAD OF SEXUAL DEPENDENCY, Morrisroe’s films were often shown in underground punk bars, independent cinemas, and intimate, occasionally deserted classrooms at Tufts University, frequently with the “actors” as the sole audience. These films, like his photographic works, are valuable not only as standalone pieces but also as part of the historical archive of what was theorized as the Boston Group. Ultimately, Morrisroe’s films remain a poignant testament to a delirious, intimate world; the beautiful memory of a home and a chosen family.",
