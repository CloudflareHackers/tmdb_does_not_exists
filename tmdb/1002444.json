  "overview": "Meeting on a Saturday morning to drink champagne, the friends embark on a new journey through the depths of the male subconscious. What are the men talking about this time? Of course, about the personal. Lyosha is trying to understand whether \"female friendship\" exists, Kamil discusses whether it is possible to fire his best friend, Lovelace Slava recalls his first love (or was it not his?), and Sasha reflects on the loss of his father and the need to enjoy life here and now. And yet, walking around the center of Moscow, friends discuss how to screw in a light bulb so that she is satisfied, and what candid photos scream about on social networks, and what is chevapchichi.",
