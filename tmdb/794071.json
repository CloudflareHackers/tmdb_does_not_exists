  "overview": "Ten years ago, small time crook Aftab Angrez made a hit-man's dream debut in the Mumbai underworld with a shocking, high-profile killing. Much to his bad luck, the credit was attributed to someone else. Now back in Mumbai, with the help of two long-retired gang-mates, he sets out to regain that long lost glory. A bitter-sweet tale about lovable losers, identity crises, dashed hopes, and many misfired bullets that is riddled with laughs.",
