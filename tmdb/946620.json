  "overview": "Found footage short film piece conceived through the articulation of appropriated and recycled film fragments to conform a unified sex scene composed by different bodies, ambients and characters. Structuring a begging, a climax and an ending. It is an inquiry into the construction of (self) identity, gender issues, memory, and the process of rewriting/reimagining personal recollections. It was assembled as a chapter for an autobiographical long film called An Appropriated Self-Portrait, edited using a fragmentary structure that relies on a linear narrative.",
