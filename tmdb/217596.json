  "overview": "A city with a history of heritage, myth and superstition. A passionate architect with strong but delusional ideas about love and life. A Czech gypsy girl searching for her identity and true love. Add to the drama of a mean friend you canâ€™t do without and cannot trust either. The conflict of these complex characters is further heightened with illusions of someone who is there but at the same time not there- what you see is not true? or is the truth, what you not see? All of the above are thrown together in a very unique and unusual situation where you do not know what to believe and what to disbelieve.",
