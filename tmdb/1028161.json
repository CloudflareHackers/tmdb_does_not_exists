  "overview": "Fascinated as much as terrified, a woman takes refuge in the privacy of her room to secretly read \"Discourse against God\" by the Marquis de Sade, which she has stolen from her husband's library. The first lines she reads make her aware of the incredibly sulphurous and anticlerical aspect of this book, because in the 18th century, the refusal of God can only be brutal and protestant, a language without limits destined to break up all the prisons of men.",
