  "overview": "As men become weaker and women’s sexuality becomes more promiscuous, the traditional model of men as the pursuers and women as the pursued is breaking down. Women are now actively seeking one-night stands and approaching men themselves. This story follows three young women and three young men, weaving in the psychological dynamics between those who do the pursuing and those who are pursued. Despite being called the “new generation,” these young people struggle with love, friendship, and human relationships, and this work portrays their human experiences",
