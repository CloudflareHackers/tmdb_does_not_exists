  "overview": "SAAT UCHAKKEY is a comedy caper about 7 petty crooks blundering their way through an exciting gamut of mystery, greed, treachery and running into one riotous crisis after another. Set against the gritty backdrop of Old Delhi, this burlesque film opens a window into the unpredictable world of magical realism, where the lingo is spattered with the choicest of swear words and the mannerisms with sidesplitting humor.",
