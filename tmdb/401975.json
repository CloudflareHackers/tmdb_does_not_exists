  "overview": "Showmen riding cinema lorries have brought the wonder of the movies to faraway villages in India once every year. Seven decades on, as their cinema projectors crumble and film reels become scarce, their patrons are lured by slick digital technology. A benevolent showman, a shrewd exhibitor and a maverick projector mechanic bear a beautiful burden - to keep the last traveling cinemas of the world running.  A critically acclaimed, poignant documentary that celebrates Indiaâ€™s travelling picture shows and laments their demise, filled with exquisite visuals and marvellous eccentrics.",
