They bring him over to their house, nurse and nurture him back to good health, only to find out that he has the mind of a 12 year of old child, and name him Bhola. Years pass by, Paro has fallen in love with Bhola, for he rescued her from a molester, and both would like to get married. Before that could happen, Bhola is viciously attacked and left for dead by Paro's molester, and is hospitalized. While in hospital, Police Sub-Inspector Abhimanyu Verma finds out that Bhola is not who he claims to be but a homicidal maniac, wanted for killing three policemen - named Bhisma - and is possibly masquerading as a 12 year old child to hide from the police.",
