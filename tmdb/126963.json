Ecstatic over the new challenge, Goku ignores King Kai's advice and battles Beerus, but he is easily overwhelmed and defeated. Beerus leaves, but his eerie remark of \"Is there nobody on Earth more worthy to destroy?\" lingers on. Now it is up to the heroes to stop the God of Destruction before all is lost.",
