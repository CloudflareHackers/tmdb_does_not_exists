  "overview": "Mika, the sultry hostess who rescues the bruised, penniless manga artist Keichi from a seedy, neon‑lit rip‑off club. After he’s beaten for failing to pay an outrageous bill, Mika can’t abandon him—she slips him into her private sanctuary. By the glow of candlelight, her cool fingers trace every bruise, her lips press soothing relief to his aching flesh. Each gentle caress ignites a fierce heat between them, awakening carnal desires neither expected. As Mika’s hair brushes his cheek, her eyes dark with secret longing, Keichi surrenders to the intoxicating pull of her world—where mercy turns into a heady, forbidden passion that neither can resist.",
