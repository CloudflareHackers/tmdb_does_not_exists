  "overview": "Free as a bird. To wander. To nestle. To take flight. We are not.  As India gained its much awaited independence in 1947, a race faced another struggle. Bengal was divided and hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were displaced and divided on the basis of their religion. The Hindus were forced out as East Bengal was made a part of Pakistan and the same fate lay in store for the Muslims of West Bengal. Millions became refugees in their own homeland, and thousands still bear the cross and the scar.  The film is a human saga of a truncated land and how people are trying to relive their destiny.",
