  "overview": "Zach Shirey says,\"I made this video when I was only 11 (I had just turned 11). OBVIOUSLY, at the time, I had not gone through puberty, but I wanted to make a film that would help explain that talking about it with our parents or another trusted adult is okay. It's not as embarrassing as it may seem. They are there to help because they've been through it too.\"",
