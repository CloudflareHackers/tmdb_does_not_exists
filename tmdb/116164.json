  "overview": "Undercover Billionaire: Comeback City will feature Stearns helping Erie business owners overcome challenges resulting from an economy that ground to a halt just under a year ago as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn each episode, Stearns will meet with an Erie business, assess its operation and identify areas that need to change. Stearns and the business owners then have 27 days to turn the business around financially.  The period of 27 days was chosen because the average small business in America has just 27 days in cash reserves.",
