Vivek has a circle of very close friends of four, with whom he discusses everything.  A phone-in programme encounter with Kavya aka Tinku (Bhama), a radio jockey, and Vivek, results in loss of Kavya's job. Some strange circumstances lead to the marriage of Vivek and Kavya, without knowing each other that they are the same people who clashed on the FM radio channel. Vivek expects Kavya to be an orthodox and simple wife of his dreams and Kavya turns out to be otherwise.",
