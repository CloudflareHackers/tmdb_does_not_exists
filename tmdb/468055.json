  "overview": "An allegorical found footage film mix, featuring fragments of TV ads of Calvin Klein fragrances, feature films about the Nazis, and Leni Riefenstahl’s works from the 1930s. With added iconic images of the Third Reich – photos of Nazi architecture and sculptures by Albert Speer and Arno Breker.  Digging into the “unconscious” of contemporary advertising, the artist traces its aesthetic genealogy. Toporowicz’s analyses (with the element of allegorical meaning added to the films) reveal the extent to which contemporary commercialised visual culture maintains fascination with Nazi aesthetics.",
