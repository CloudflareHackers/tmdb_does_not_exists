  "overview": "Cockpit is a historic foray into the lustful world of World War II, where the battles raged not just on the front lines, but in the bedrooms of soldiers and sirens alike. Inspired by the era's memorable figures and phrases, this adult feature transports viewers to a time when the world was aflame and passion was the ultimate combatant. Join these American heroes as they take on the loveliest of ladies from across the seas, their ardor matched only by the intensity of their duties. When love became a duty, and silk stockings whispered sweet nothings, the stakes were higher than ever before - and the payoff was more thrilling than any victory. Cockpit is a retro-erotic journey that will leave you breathless and wanting more.",
