  "overview": "When anarchy prevails and the screams of the downtrodden become lifeless, a saviour is born to eliminate the tyrants and put an end to their immoral activities. Surajbhan (Mukesh Rishi) is the name of one such despot and Shantinagar is the base of his illegal activities. D.C.P. Shrivastav (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Thapar (Shiva) are hand-in-glove with him. Krishna (Sunil Shetty) is a victim of Surajbhan's atrocities and has returned from jail after serving a sentence. He learns of Surajbhan's renewed reign of terror and the growth of his illegal activities. How Krishna frees Shantinagar from the clutches of Surajbhan, forms the crux of the film.",
