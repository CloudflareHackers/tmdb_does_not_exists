  "overview": "Charlie drives a car with his mother on a country road on a dark autumn afternoon. Suddenly they see a child running out of the forest, as if in a panic. The mother slows down and the child just manages to escape into the forest. It turns out to be the first of several strange and terrifying revelations along the way. Roadkill is a surreal short film about how life is valued differently, seen from a child's perspective.",
