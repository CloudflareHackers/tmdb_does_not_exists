On the front lines, where good and evil collide, is a soldier in search of his past and his future. Spawn, formerly known as Al Simmons, is a CIA hitman whose death causes him to seal a deal with the devil so that he can return to his wife Wanda. Instead, the devil transforms him into 'hell-spawn,' a dark warrior who battles the forces of evil on Earth--and in himself--to uncover the truth about his identity and fulfill his destiny.",
