  "overview": "My sister and I moved into a new house. We didn't do much but the woman downstairs came up to ask us to keep it down.  She said she was sensitive so we decided to keep it down.  Her gangster husband would beat her when he came home drunk.  Every time I heard her suffer from the beatings, I couldn't stand it and would stomp the floor to create a distraction.  She would come up telling us to be quiet.  I told her I did it intentionally. I also decided to do something about the woman who showed interest in me by memorizing my number.",
