  "overview": "A group of New Yorkers take a road trip to Texas, to visit the locations from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Their car is disabled. As they wait in a desolate part of the state, a hiker discovers the travelers and offers refuge at her home, which happens to be five hours away by foot. When the gang arrives at what looks like a hovel, their northern attitudes and prejudices clash with the southerners, and a sadistic game ensues. All will learn what it means when someone says, \"Don't mess with Texas.\"",
