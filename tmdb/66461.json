  "overview": "40 bottles a day, 420 diapers a week and feedings every three hours became the new normal for Danielle and Adam Busby when they welcomed home the only all-female set of quintuplets in the country. The family of three became a family of eight overnight, and TLC follows that incredible journey in the new series \"OUTDAUGHTERED\". The series captures Danielle, Adam and their adorable 4-year-old daughter Blayke as they adjust to their new life, while trying to hold on to the identities and lives they had cultivated before the five new additions arrived. Following the hilarious and heartwarming antics of the entire family including Danielle's zany mother, Michelle, and her older twin sisters and their families, it's all hands on deck as the family relies on their tight-knit circle to make the most out of this incredible lifetime adventure.",
