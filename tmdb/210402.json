But lately, he's gotten even worse. Only Beth can save Gus from his insanity, but she'll have to do something she swore she'd never do: enter into a sexual relationship with him. Will her sexual healing make Gus sane? Or will it be the deathnell of Gus' delicate psyche? Tune into Wet Nurse, and nurse that boner into a healthy tumescence.",
