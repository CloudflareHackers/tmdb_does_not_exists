  "overview": "Andrew Carver was born under a bad sign! His life is one long train wreck of bad luck that could drive any man to insanity. But on one particularly lonely night, the Devil herself appears in his bedroom, and when she offers to make every twisted sexual fantasy he could ever dream of become a reality in exchange for his soul. He quickly makes his fateful decision. With the snap of her finger, Andrew is living the life he always dreamed of. Residing in a luxurious mansion with all of the gorgeous young women he could ever handle in an eternal non-stop orgy of torrid sexual debauchery that most men can only imagine. From the sizzling hot three way sexual trysts to the mind bending blowjobs that await him around ever corner. He soon discovers that this mysterious place between Heaven and Hell is far from the paradise he envisioned, and now he wants out of the deal, and far away from this Devil's Playground.",
