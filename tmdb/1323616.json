  "overview": "Following the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017, Shia LaBeouf and his artist friends launched a live stream art project called 'HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US' that ran for four years, the duration of Trump's presidential term. But what began as a spirited display of resistance against the divisive presidential election result quickly devolved into an internet meme. The live stream attracted attention from the darkest corners of 4CHAN, encouraging trolls who made it their life's mission to ruin Shia's art project.",
