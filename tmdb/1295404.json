  "overview": "In a community of workers who recycle coal slurry from the adjoining coal washery in the Mailagora coalfields, a casual worker-Babulal Bhuiya- was killed by Industrial Security Guards (CISF) in February 1981. The murder was followed by protests from the slurry field workers who denounced the harassment they faced from the guards. It is also a film about the state of workers’ living conditions at the time and about the awareness that the “sacrifice” of Babulal Bhuiya raised in other workers.",
