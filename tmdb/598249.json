  "overview": "This spunky indie revolves around an independent young woman who faces an alienating world with her own set of values and relationships. Makoto does not lead a “good” life. She hates her family, dates a married man, and moonlights as a phone sex operator. Though she is busy everyday with work and rituals, she has no idea where her meaningless life is heading. Then one day, a good man, as kind and grounded as they come, enters her life and tries to straighten things out.",
