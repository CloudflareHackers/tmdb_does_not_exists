  "overview": "When Brandi takes a shot at social media fame, she decides to rely on her best assets and begins modeling lingerie. But as demands from a content-hungry public increase, and blood-thirsty influencers up the ante, Brandi soon learns that to keep her competitive edge, she'll have to rely on her friends. All is well at first, feeding her eager neighbor to her bohunk husband for the drooling masses, but soon she's bringing her innocent cousin into her saucy streams and they all cross a point of no return. Whoever she meets is sucked into her webcam world, and it seems no one can escape Brandi's bad influence.",
