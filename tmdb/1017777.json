  "overview": "A beautiful young man is riding a train when a suspicious man comes and snuggles up to him. A man who snuggles up to you even if you run away. Eventually, when he arrives at the station, the man gets off, but leaves a book. Thinking that the man might have forgotten it, he picks up the book. The book is \"Gay Toybox\". When he finally opens the book, the movie begins with an epilogue. The movie is an omnibus of three features. In other words, each book is an elaborate composition of one story of the gay world that is developed in that book.",
