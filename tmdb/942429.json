Once she hears about an upcoming promotion within the company, Aimee becomes determined to prove to her boss that she is the right 'man' for the job, but will her boss take her seriously? Aimee decides to throw a dinner party with her boss as the guest of honor in hopes of impressing him enough so that he gives her the promotion.
