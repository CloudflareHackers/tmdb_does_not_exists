One day, while Mitsuko was away on a Buddhist memorial service, Shinsuke called up a Japanese sex club hostess, Hiromi, and they had a flaming game of widowhood. Soon after, Mitsuko suddenly returned home, saying that she had been involved in an accident on the road. In fact, Mitsuko was having an affair with her lover Kamonari when he was injured in a car accident. Later, Kamonari came to visit her at the pension, but Shinsuke thought he was just a guest. When Shinsuke went out for shopping, Kamonari proposed to Mitsuko. Hiromi also shows up at the pension. What will become of the couple's love?",
