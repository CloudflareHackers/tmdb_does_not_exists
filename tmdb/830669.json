  "overview": "Part of the Imperial War Museum Collection.  Produced by the Crown Film Unit for the Ministry of Defence and the Admiralty in 1943, Close Quarters is an authentic impression of a routine wartime Royal Navy submarine patrol in the North Sea, off the coast of Norway.  At first the patrol is uneventful until HMS Tyrant comes across a U-boat. All the roles were performed by serving submariners (led by Lieutenant Commander Gregory) and much of the film was shot on a genuine British submarine which was still in service.",
