  "overview": "Christie's business is growing and in need of more workers, which is when she hires Evelyn. Evelyn comes with glowing reviews from past employers, but it quickly becomes apparent that Evelyn is nothing but a slacker! Meanwhile, three coworkers are nervously waiting to be called on by their boss. It's time for their performance reviews and they all seem extremely worried. After examining each of their files, Vicki comes to the conclusion that none of them are stellar employees. However, Vicki is willing to make their reviews positive. Meanwhile, Mayor Jamie Michelle is frustrated. Her husband cheated on her and now everyone in the world is aware of the scandal! But at least she's alone in her office with her trusty bodyguard, Ellie Lilly. Ellie admits that she never liked Jamie's husband and that Jamie deserves so much better. Jamie realizes that Ellie has been the one by her side, no matter what. Maybe the person she really should've been with was right in front of her the whole time!",
