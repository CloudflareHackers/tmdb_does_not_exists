  "overview": "Tamura Masakazu plays Shohei Yamauchi, a freelance reporter obsessed with finding out the truth about a traffic accident in which his beloved daughter died. Judging by the photo of the accident, which appeared in the news described by photojournalists as \"one coincidence in a hundred thousand\", and the survivor's testimony that \"I saw a red fireball\" immediately before the accident, the circumstances of the accident are questionable.\r The film is based on a late masterpiece by Seicho Matsumoto.",
