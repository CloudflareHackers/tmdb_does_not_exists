  "overview": "In 2020 an enormous government project started in Mexico. Some 1525 kilometres of railway tracks are being built, more or less along the coast, on the peninsula of Yucatán, the cradle of Mayan culture. The filmmakers follow the route, where some of the tracks are already in place, and where a train once ran. With archival footage and serene views of the splendid landscape, they calmly investigate what the colourful people who live along the route think of Tren Maya. Much is already being lost as a result of tourism, especially in the coastal resorts of Cancun and Tulum, since Mayan culture is so closely intertwined with nature. The broad variety of backgrounds and ages of the inhabitants of Yucatán yields a nuanced and colourful story.",
