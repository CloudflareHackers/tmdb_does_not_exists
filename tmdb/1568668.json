  "overview": "Roi Roi Binale is a soul-stirring Assamese musical that weaves together themes of love, art, identity, and the lingering shadows of a region scarred by past turmoil.  Set against the backdrop of a region recovering from the scars of terrorism, Roi Roi Binale subtly explores the enduring impact of trauma. Its central question, whether art should serve the artist or the people, drives the narrative, as each character seeks their own truth.",
