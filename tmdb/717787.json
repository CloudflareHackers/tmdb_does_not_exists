As luck would have it, an anonymous letter taped to the bottom of her desk provides a perfect distraction. Little does Sori know that she’s about to embark on the scavenger hunt of a lifetime! What starts off as simple curiosity becomes a healing journey as Sori discovers just how far a small act of kindness can go.",
