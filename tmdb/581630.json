  "overview": "Finally Bhalobasha depicts three stories that narrate the relationships between people of different age and gender, which is considered as a social taboo in our society. The movie very aesthetically shows how people in such relations go through the test of time by mentally juggling the concept of sin and their need of physical longing that finally transcends into true love.",
