  "overview": "Since Jewell Marceau's stepdaughter, Freya Parker, forgot her lunch at home, Jewell goes to Freya's high school to deliver it to her at lunchtime. Jewell's taken aback, however, when she finds Freya all alone in an empty classroom. That's when Jewell learns that Freya has been spending her lunches alone lately since the other students have been bullying her after she came out as a lesbian. Myra Moans approaches her stepmom, Lauren Phillips, saying that she needs new clothes. What's wrong with Myra's old clothes that she needs new ones? Myra says her clothes have gotten worn out, plus they don't fit as well as they used to. Lauren takes a closer look, then does a double-take as she notices that Myra has grown into quite the young woman, with her feminine curves filling in her clothing in all the right ways! Serene Siren returns home from work, and is pleasantly surprised at the sight of her stepdaughter Chloe Surreal making dinner in the kitchen.",
