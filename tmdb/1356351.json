As these two lives converge more and more, Peter will have to decide between continuing his mission as a superhero, or giving it all up for a better life. Eventually, Peter gives in to the weight of his responsibilities, abandoning the mantle of Spider-Man, but the consequences of this loss for the city are too great to ignore, and he understands that he cannot turn his back on the people, because with great power comes great responsibility.",
