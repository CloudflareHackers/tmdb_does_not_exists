  "overview": "A provocative retort to the current legitimation of sexual violence by the established power, Xvideo re-explores the chronology of the abduction, gang rape, and murder of an eight-year-old girl by seven Hindu men inside a temple for eight consecutive days. Through poetic vomit, the film relentlessly questions abuse of power, patriarchy, religious fanaticism, and caste politics that use rape as a propaganda tool.",
