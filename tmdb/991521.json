  "overview": "Two world's collide, of a father and a son as they move towards the bigger priorities of their lives. Madhusudhan, the head of Nirupama old age home, strives every day to spread happiness and cheer in a place that houses a deep sense of loss and rejection. A home inhabited by frail and old abandoned people, who have nowhere else to go and call Nirupama their home. Tapan, Madhusudhan's only son grew up training himself to survive the world alone. He blames Madhusudhan for being a father in absentia and also for his mother's death. The story takes us through an emotional roller-coaster of a father and son relationship in the backdrop of Kolkata- a city jostling between fading tradition and modernity taking over.",
