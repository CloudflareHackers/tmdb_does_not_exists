But when his cab gets a flat tire in the middle of nowhere, Bhaskar's journey takes a wild turn. He accepts a lift from a mysterious stranger, only to discover that his new driver is harboring a dark secret-a dead body in the trunk. As the tension mounts, Bhaskar is joined by another unwitting passenger: the wife of a police officer, who also hitches a ride. Caught between the terrifying reality of the situation and his own fear, Bhaskar must navigate this nerve-wracking journey without tipping off the suspicious man who holds all the power-and a gun. Will Bhaskar find a way out of this deadly predicament, or is he trapped in a ride straight to disaster?",
