  "overview": "Seductive Selena Rose looks after her boss, Kayden Kross, as the indecisive beauty can’t choose between suitors Tommy Gunn and Richie Calhoun. It also helps that Selena knows Richie is only interested in getting laid as evident by the fierce fucking he gives her on the side. When Kayden leaves on a weekend business trip, Selena’s old friends drop by to celebrate the “success” she’s led them to believe she’s attained which includes owning Kayden’s mansion. Some old flings are also invited to the party leading to romances rekindled. Adrianna Luna cozies up to James Deen for a hardcore hook-up while Kelly Surfer pleases Marcus London’s man pole. After a frisky pillow fight, Bill Bailey finally scores with Selena. Kayden comes back to meet up with Tommy for a night of hardcore passion and her own Secret Sleepover.",
