Sadly, even the most noble of plans can go horribly awry. With the use of a sacred bell, the head of the Bai Yue Sect, Hua Lian (Jessica Hsuan), ensnares the Blood Demon’s mind, forcing him to murder his wife before killing himself.\n\nTaking in the Blood Demon’s orphaned daughter, Shu Jingrong (Crystal Yuan), Bai Di raises her as his own. Trained alongside her master’s disciples, Jingrong, Qinglan (Han Cheng Yu), Qingyu (Zhao Dong Ze), Xiao Yiqing (Qin Jun Jie) grow into skilled masters of Wulin. Though peace may reign for a time, tragedy is never far away. When disaster strikes, Jingrong discovers she is cursed with misfortune and becomes overwhelmed by guilt.",
