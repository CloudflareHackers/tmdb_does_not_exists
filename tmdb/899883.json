  "overview": "Jonathan Graves is a charismatic career magician known for his confidence, verbal agility — and for his gift for manipulation. Although he has many fans, he is made more than a few enemies amongst his fellow magicians since publishing \"Naked Illusion,\" a controversial best-seller that blows the lid off the craft's most time-honored secrets. When it is revealed that his manager is having an affair with his wife, Graves exacts revenge by killing her and framing the manager for the dirty deed. However, his assistant Trisha attempts to turn the tables on him. She uses her knowledge of the facts as leverage for his affections — and a handsome raise, in a desperate attempt to beat the master at his own game. Meanwhile, a detective who has rejected Graves' alibis from the beginning puts the facts together, and the nefarious master of puppets soon finds himself behind bars. However, can even a cold steel jail cell stop this lord of illusions from disappearing into the dead of night?",
