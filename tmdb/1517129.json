  "overview": "Migrant and aspiring actress Thooya navigates Mumbai by leveraging beauty and wit, occasionally trading intimacy for opportunity. When she sublets her sugar daddy’s upscale apartment to Swetha, a fellow migrant working a corporate job, the two women from seemingly different worlds begin sharing more than just living space. Amid Mumbai’s relentless pulse, they discover silent empathy, though personal histories and wounds test their delicate connection in a strange and tender unfolding – of selfhood, of survival, of unexpected kinship.",
