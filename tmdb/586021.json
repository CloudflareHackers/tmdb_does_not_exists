  "overview": "Alaskan gold miner John Reeves, a private landowner with no scientific training, stumbles upon a rare collection of bones of Ice Age creatures that roamed the region tens of thousands of years ago including bison, woolly mammoths, and prehistoric bears.  Stored in a permafrost deep-freeze for years, these remains are in pristine condition and represent an unprecedented window into the life of the Pleistocene Epoch. John finds a passion for bones and for collecting, assembling over a hundred thousand specimens from his mine site, â€œThe Boneyard,\" and invites a team of expert paleontologists to study the collection. As the scientists wade into the mud, and peruse the boxes of the collection, discoveries are made that could potentially re-write the history of North America.",
