  "overview": "There's a serial killer on the loose and only one person can stop him ... or her ... and it's Jenna, The It Girl. Set in the high-fashion world of show-bars, Jenna takes you from pole dancing to pole slamming, with glam-queens Monique Alexander, Wendy Devine, Dee and Nicole Sheridan all in heels, right behind her. They're fleeing a killer, but they give some killer head in the process ... and in the end ... it's non-stop sex to die for. And that my friends, is how Jenna got to be The It Girl.",
