Later on, realizing her mistake, Vasanti apologizes to him and the two fall in love. Vasanti's elder sister, Geeta (Usha Kiron), supports the family by stitching clothes. Raj rents the room upstairs in their house. He falls ill and in nursing him, Geeta falls in love with him. She confides her love to Vasanti, who decides to sacrifice her love for the sake of her sister and convinces Raj to marry Geeta. Raj initially neglects Geeta. On finding out, Vasanti writes to him that their sacrifice, made for Geeta's happiness, would mean nothing unless he is a good husband to Geeta. Raj relents and marries Geeta and they have a son. Vasanti joins them and Geeta suspects that there is something on between Raj and Vasanti and makes Vasanti leave the house.",
