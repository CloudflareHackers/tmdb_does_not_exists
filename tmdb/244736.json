Whilst on a trip to a hill station, they meet a 5 year old girl who takes them to her home and exposes an unknown truth - the little girl Dolly is Shyam's own daughter by Radha. Rukmini rises to the occasion as a great woman and accepts and adopts Radha as a second wife of Shyam and Dolly as their daughter, without caring for society and the law. They live happily under one roof until Dolly falls in love with a high society advocate's son Amit. But society doesn't accept Dolly and charges her of being a illegal child and they must face both social and legal barriers as well as family turmoil in a fight to be together.",
