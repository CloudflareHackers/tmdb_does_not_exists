  "overview": "Evicted from the army for her  reckless attitude, the hotshot pilot Captain Walker is re-incorporated when, out of desperation, the hierarchy must call on her services to train an overwhelmingly recalcitrant feminine squad of elite pilots. Nostalgic of her years under the flag, the proud aviatrix accepts the mission, not knowing it is nothing else than a scheme to definitively compromise her.  Resilience, cunning and charm will then be her best assets to get the upper hand over the obnoxious Colonel White.",
