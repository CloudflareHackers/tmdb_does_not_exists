  "overview": "#VIRAL WORLD is a suspense relationship drama that opens with a 24-year old girl jumping off a building. The whole story happens over  computer screens, series of video calls, several YouTube videos,  collection of social-media stories and a bunch of text messages. This  story is about how relationships drift apart on the virtual world.  Swapna, a girl who has just moved to the United States for higher  studies, tries to save her 4-year old relationship with whatever it  takes. Aditi, an emotionally dependent girl living by herself, tries to  establish an emotional bond with a guy she meets on a social-media  platform. These girls trust their guys and the internet, but neither  deserve their trust! Who is the girl that takes her life?  The movie explores long distance relationships and how these  relationships are being affected by social-media platforms. It also  expostulates a burning cybercrime, which exploits the privacy of young girls and women over the internet.",
