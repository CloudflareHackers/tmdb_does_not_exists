Over millions of years, the Monsuno essence slowly disappeared as it dropped deeper and deeper below the planetâ€™s surface, until a scientist named Jeredy Suno at the secret government agency found a way to bring them back and control. He took his research and vanished, but not before he left his only son a special gift.",
