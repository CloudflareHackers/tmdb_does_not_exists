As such accusation hurts her feelings, Ji-won intentionally approaches Yun-jeong’s ex-girlfriend, Min-a and revises her play script that gradually begins to resemble the story of a real-life ex-lesbian couple, Yun-jeong and Min-a. At the same time, Ji-won gets carried away by her growing feelings for Min-a.",
