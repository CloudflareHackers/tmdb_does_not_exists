  "overview": "The true story of a pair of college students who attempted a double suicide to end their doomed romance becomes fare for legendary pinku-eiga director Hisayasu Sato in this feature. Fatalistic and sad, this is one of the more depressing Japanese softcore films, and Sato makes it even worse by including footage from the loversâ€™ actual 8 mm experimental film throughout the story",
