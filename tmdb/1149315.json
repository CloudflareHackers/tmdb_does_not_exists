  "overview": "A long, long time ago in an era called the 1950's, there was a girl who wanted to be a star. A movie star. So she came to Hollywood and met a big producer and almost made it in the movies, but she wouldn't make it with the boss. Too bad she sidestepped the casting couch only to find herself posing nude for stag films, and beyond. So she never became a movie star. Instead, she became a pin-up legend who started a revolution.",
