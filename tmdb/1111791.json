Xia Ding fled to Taiping Town and grew up here with the girl A Li. Xia Ding fought against the evil dragon and wolf to protect the people of Taiping Town. When the barbarians invaded Taiping Town, Xia Ding finally knew that he was the feathered man chosen by the God of Thunder. He grew wings, drew thunder and lightning, killed all the barbarians and the witch. Unfortunately, his lover Ah Li's heart was ripped out by a witch and died. Xia Ding used his wings to protect Ah Li and turned into a stone figurine. 100 years later, during thunder and lightning, the stone cracked and gave birth to a boy. Ji Chang happened to be passing by and adopted him as his godson, naming him Lei Zhenzi. From then on, Lei Zhenzi, who could grow wings and drew the power of thunder and lightning, helped Ji Chang conquer King Zhou.",
