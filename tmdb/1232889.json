  "overview": "Mariana is a systematic girl. She studies English and German at a language school. She works in a call center as many hours as possible and saves everything she earns. To entertain herself a little, she looks for men in bars with whom she only plans to spend one night. Why compromise if she just wants to travel? That is Mariana's plan, to go away and what better than to an island in the Mediterranean. But Gabriel, an unlikely boy who keeps getting into her life with bad jokes and uncomfortable questions, forces her to look at herself and wonder what she wants to run away from.",
