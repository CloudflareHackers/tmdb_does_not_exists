  "overview": "Susan and Joy are catching up when Susan's teen, Jessica, comes home with her friend Allison. Jessica asks Susan if Allison can stay the night, claiming they need to study for a big test the next day. Susan curtly agrees, on the condition that they don't stay up late. They plunge into an intense, sexual encounter that will keep both their secrets intact! Penny arrives at the beautiful home of Charlie Foster. However, the woman who greets Penny at the door is not Charlie but Jacqueline, who doesn't seem too fond of Penny. As Jacqueline leads Penny through the house and explains the rules, it is revealed that Charlie likes to rescue homeless girls by inviting them to join her harem. Jacqueline is the eldest \"sibling\", and Penny is the newest one. Charlie then invites Penny to join them, in order to give her a proper welcome into this growing \"family\".",
