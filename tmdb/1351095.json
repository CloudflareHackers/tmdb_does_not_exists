Working alongside charming croupier Wyatt, Wendyâ€™s instructed to take special care of high-profile client Jack Staal. Jack has deep pockets, and his current winning streak is as suspicious as the company he keeps, exposing Wendy to a criminal underworld filled with high rollers spending their money on escorts and over-the-top sexual experiences. Wyatt has eyes for the beautiful Wendy, as does Jack, whose favorite escorts Candy and Gina suggest she abandon waitressing for the far more lucrative sex trade. But Wyatt raises the stakes when he reveals himself as an undercover detective.",
