  "overview": "Eugene O'Neill's semi-autobiographical masterpiece pulls back the curtain on the Connecticut home of the Tyrone family, where deep-seated resentments and bourbon-fueled tirades cause a family to expose their darkest natures. Starring Alfred Molina as James Tyrone and Jane Kaczmarek as Mary Cavan Tyrone, this powerful production depicts a single day that begins as any other, only to become a night from which they will never recover.",
