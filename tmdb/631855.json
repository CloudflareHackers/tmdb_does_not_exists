  "overview": "A documentary on the infamous Bengali magic realist, Nabarun is an exclamation mark in Bengali literature, the emphatic interjector. The film tries to get into the noisy, grimy, scratchy insides of Nabarun's mind as his characters shamelessly hustle, behave atrociously and try to exist in a violent hostile world.",
