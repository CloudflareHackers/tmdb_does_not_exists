  "overview": "Life, a wonderful unsolved Enigma. A puzzle to many and a poetry by the philosophers.  As it still remains unknown yet it's lived by all in many ways, in different ways, in easy ways and mostly in difficult ways. No one has ever concluded as to how the fates of different people get entwined in this one singular Life which is so diverse beyond anybody's comprehension. The question still remains unanswered as to how in this one Life, people live different lives yet come together at least once through a cord that weaves their fates with the same fabric. Call it love, humanity, empathy or anything as long as the vibes keep people connected.  And the outcome of all the connections are not necessarily defined. Many result in an indescribable abstract outcome. Not everything, not every emotion has to be conventional.",
