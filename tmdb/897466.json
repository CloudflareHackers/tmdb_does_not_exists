Her husband Roger is a complete bore in and out of the sack and Beth is sick of it. Beth wants a way out of her marriage. A chance to live, have fun, live dangerously! One day, on her way home, Beth runs into Ivy stranded on the side of the road. Once the two women start talking, they realize they have something in common--a miserable marriage. Together the two women plan a scheme that will not only get them out of their marriages, but assure them financial security as well. What they soon learn though is that even the best plans backfire. Be careful what you wish for, it just might come true and you may end up getting screwed.",
