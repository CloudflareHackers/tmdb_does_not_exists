  "overview": "Somewhere in Queens, a vibrant part of New York City's urban fabric, a young woman experiences unrequited love for a man she met at a recreational soccer tournament. This experience will lead her on an emotional odyssey that echoes Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's timeless classic, The Sorrows of Young Werther.  A female-driven, contemporary-set film version of a dense, soaring literary text radiating with poetic concision and graceful linearity. A debut work by an author who skillfully constructs shots, works with precision on timing and tackles dialogue capable of sounding at once \"extemporaneous,\" pregnant and poetic.",
