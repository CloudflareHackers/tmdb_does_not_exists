They live together with the owner of the place, Kaname Toki in an at-home environment. Lately, Kaname’s kohai, Fuwa has been coming by frequently. Seeing Fuwa, who has lost his ability to get hard, Kaname’s father Minami invites him to the establishment to try to stimulate him. His partner is Shido, who has had an interest in Fuwa, however, Fuwa’s expression remains stiff. The reason for this is that the mayor of the town is leading a redevelopment movement, and Kaname’s establishment is in an area that needs to be evicted. Fuwa has been in charge of the eviction and is thus troubled. Shido finds out about his situation and the shop’s upcoming fate. Meanwhile, Kaname proposes to Sora and she begins to have feelings for him. Both parties are at a crossroads…. what will they choose?",
