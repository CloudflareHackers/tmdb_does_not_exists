  "overview": "For Taboo, the artist explored the village of Borunda in Rajasthan, where each community occupied their own space, based on caste-ordained professions. Malani chose to film the weavers, where the low-end jobs are done by women, but under no circumstances are they allowed to touch the loom. They are thus excluded from the most important part of the process, where male supremacy rules.",
