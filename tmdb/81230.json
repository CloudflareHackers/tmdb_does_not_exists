But Luna already has a girlfriend named Klara Rojek and is a lesbian so Kostek has more than a few things that are in his way of ever being with her. Kostek does whatever it takes to talk to Luna and tries to get her attention, including trying out for a porn movie Klara's feminist group is making. After some lengthily casting, Klara concludes that Kostek is the ideal guy for Luna to star in the film with.",
