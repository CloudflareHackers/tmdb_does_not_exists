  "overview": "The film portrays the undocumented lives of the Pardhi community, a marginalized tribe in Maharashtra labeled as  \"born criminals\" during the colonial era. Despite 75 years of Indian independence, their socio-economic conditions remain unchanged. The Pardhi are a nomadic tribe deprived of land, housing, education, and stable professions, often linked to theft and robbery.  The story follows a teenage girl determined to become a teacher despite facing personal, familial, social, and cultural challenges. Her journey highlights the systemic barriers faced by the Pardhi community. The film delves into issues such as their struggle to prove Indian citizenship, lack of education, and societal neglect.",
