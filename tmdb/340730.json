They arrive near Amritsar and take over the vacant house of Pervez Shahbudin - with it's lone occupant, a male child, left behind by his parents. Amrit gets to adopt him after Rajveer is unable to locate his parents, and they call him Ehsaan - who soon grows up to excel in studies and sports. On a trip to Kashmir, he meets with and falls in love with Chandni rather dramatically, and is overjoyed to learn that she also is from Amritsar.",
