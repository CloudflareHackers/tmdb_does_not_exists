  "overview": "Set in 1948, a year after independence, Gajar Ka Halwa is a deeply personal tale of love, loss, and the invisible scars of Partition. In the fictional town of Navkot, a father and daughter, Ardaas and Baani, wait for the return of Harman, their wife, and mother, whilst clinging onto hope through letters and a simple recipe that carries memories of home.  But this is no ordinary story. Told through the voice of Laqeer, a personified boundary burdened by the weight of separation, the film explores the quiet aftermath of the Partition- not just the displacement, but the lingering absence, the unanswered letters, the daunting secrets, and the wounds that time cannot heal.  With poetry, music, and unforgettable characters, Gajar Ka Halwa is a poignant reflection on love that lingers- warm, wistful, and bittersweet, just like the first bite of something once familiar yet forever changed.",
