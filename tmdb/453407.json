  "overview": "This is the Americanized version of the 1985 Italian sex comedy Le d√©clic (\"The Click\"). For this U.S. release, about half of the original footage was dropped and all-new scenes were filmed by director Steve Barnett in the early 90s for executive producer Roger Corman. The resulting mishmash was released to home video in 1993 on Corman's label New Horizons.",
