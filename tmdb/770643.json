  "overview": "For a con-artist couple, a premeditated jewelry heist at a posh resort yields unexpected payoffs when they arrive in the middle of a swingers' convention. Charming, sexy and no strangers to the art of seduction, China and Michael are amateurs when it comes to the \"lifestyle\" but eagerly throw themselves into their education - with sizzling results. But recreational romance becomes a bitter pill for the grifters when their jaded hearts get in the way of what could be their most lucrative swindle yet. They may be experts at the art of flimflam, but they still have a lot to learn about love.",
