  "overview": "The film is about a young man hovering on the threshold of action andrest. For the most part he sits or stretches out in his room, back to the camera, relaxed, quivering, organic. The sketches on the wall above his bed change periodically like the seasons and are linked remotely, by a kind of logical presumption to his own artistic impulse.",
