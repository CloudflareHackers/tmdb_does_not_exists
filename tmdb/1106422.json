  "overview": "As young writer Sean (Trevor Zen) prepares an article on female sexuality in the astrological signs, he has begun the search for his sexual soul mate. Shay (Aurora Snow) is a woman who's inner Virgo is an insatiable wildcat that holds the secret to leaving her lovers breathless. Together, they embark on a dark, mysterious journey into depths of the Zodiac, an incarnation of erotic decadence, where the signs of the stars host a never ending sexual feast as diverse and perverted as the men and women it consumes. From wild, animalistic encounters in the great outdoors, to the moans and screams of the steaming hot female love triangles, their sexual boundaries are pushed to the breaking point and no one will ever live or love the same in this torrid tale of the twelve signs of ultimate sin.",
