  "overview": "It is the first time that Le√Øla Shahid has agreed to a portrait. At a time when news images blind us and fuel debate, this film takes a step back and looks at the history of a land torn apart, through the personal story of a unique ambassador. Hope and peace are still the key words of the woman who has, for over 30 years, pleaded the cause of the Palestinian people in Europe.",
