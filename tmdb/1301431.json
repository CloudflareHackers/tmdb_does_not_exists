  "overview": "Cricket Sullivan (Skye Dakota Turner) is an introverted 14-year-old struggling to come to terms with a broken family. Drawn to churches as an easy mark to steal candles for her sick mother, she is caught by a grieving choir director and set a penance of polishing the church pews. The most unlikely friendship emerges as Cricket finds her true gift to the world and unlocks a channel through which both student and choir director can face their own fears and emotions. This is a lyrical film about love, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit.",
