  "overview": "Janine meets a friend at a party. They have sex. Someone watches. Janine makes a run for it, to a plane headed anywhere... until the jet does an 'emergency,' landing in a small town. There's only one small problem: The crew looks remarkably like the one she left behind. And someone still watches. With a gun. Join adult's top director Paul Thomas and megastar Janine, in a trip thru time zones and time, where everybody's somebody and nobody's who they seem. Except Janine. Who's always hot. Layover, now boarding.",
