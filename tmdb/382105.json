  "overview": "A road trip with your best friends - the ultimate way to spend your holidays! That's certainly what Bobby, Shannon, and the gang thought when they set off on an adventure of a lifetime. But when their truck breaks down in the middle of night, in the middle of nowhere without phone signal, they have no option to but to seek refuge in a creepy old mansion. Welcomed to spend the night by the brother and sister who live alone in the old house - very strange things begin to occur! As the local cops don't seem to want to help and are equally as odd as the gang's brother and sister hosts - the five friends have to keep their wits and sanity about them and hatch an ingenious plan, as the road-trip adventure rapidly turns into whirlwind of spooks and crazy mysterious goings-on.",
