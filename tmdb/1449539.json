  "overview": "Riwaj is a powerful and thought-provoking drama that highlights the struggles of women caught in the grip of oppressive traditions. At its core is Zainab (Myraa Sareen), a courageous woman who refuses to be a victim of triple talaq. Stripped of her dignity and abandoned by the law, she is left to fend for herself in a society that seeks to silence her. But instead of succumbing to despair, she rises-challenging deep-rooted injustices and fighting for her rights, freedom, and identity.",
