  "overview": "In 1967, the fledgling nation of Israel overcame impossible odds to defeat its Arab neighbors Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six Day War. But did the Bible actually predict the conflict's outcome more than 1,000 years before it happened -- and did the event mark the start of Armageddon? This fascinating program probes these questions from a variety of angles and raises a few more through interviews with scholars, theologians and other experts.",
