  "overview": "You’ve heard the stories… You’ve seen the footage… But what if everything you thought you knew about UFOs and aliens was a LIE? The government won’t touch it. Scientists won’t admit it. Even the UFO community won’t face it. Why? Because this truth is too dangerous, too shocking, and too convicting to accept. A cosmic deception is unfolding before our eyes and it will soon ensnare the entire world. But there IS a way to unmask their true identity. Once you see it, you will never be able to go back. The book of Revelation reveals their hidden agenda—their grand plan of lying wonders that will march the whole world into the enforcement of the mark of the beast that will decide the fate of the souls of men.",
