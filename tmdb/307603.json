So when he assures Seth Dhanraj that he will deliver his missing daughter, Sheetal, to him even if he has to sacrifice his life, one can do nothing but believe in him. Raja Thakur does find Sheetal, only now she is known as Janniya, a dancing courtesan. He also finds out the people responsible for her plight, and decides to teach them a lesson. Before he could do so, Sheetal is kidnapped by a city gangster and held for ransom. Now Raja Thakur will have to leave the rural area, where he rules, and go into an unknown territory, to deal with unknown gangsters, and he must do so in order to keep his word.",
