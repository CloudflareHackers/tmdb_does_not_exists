  "overview": "In the beginning, there was sound. It has been used throughout history as a transformational tool in ceremonies, celebrations and even in times of war. It can soothe us in the form of a gentle rain or create anxiety invoked by blaring sirens passing by. Will sound, vibration and frequency be the medicine of the future? What if your words could literally change the world around you? Are we capable of healing through sound vibration? From plants to outer space, GOING OM explores the secrets and power of sound.",
