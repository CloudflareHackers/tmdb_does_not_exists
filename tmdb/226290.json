  "overview": "After vanquishing the army of the Kauravas, the Pandava Brothers preside over Indraprastha, and Arjun takes a journey to worship Bhagwan Shri Shivji. It is during this journey that he will challenge Devrishi Narad that no one on Earth can instigate him to go against Bhagwan Shri Kishan. Arjun will soon have to mince his words when, on Subhadra's insistence, he will be compelled to take up arms and go to war against Kishanji in order to protect Chitrasen - who had inadvertently offended Sage Gabal - leading to Kishanji's decision to behead the former with his Sudarshan Chakra.",
