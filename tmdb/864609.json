  "overview": "At 6 am on June 21, a doctor in the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic meets a woman clad in a protective suit during his morning jog. After ignoring the womanâ€™s pleas to see a patient at her house, he receives a blow to the head and collapses. Upon waking up, he finds himself trapped in the house of three women who call each other \"mamoni.\" The house is a swamp of time and space where the same people repeat the same actions and words every day at the same time. When the doctor, who only looks for an opportunity to escape, eventually becomes accustomed to the death-like life, a crack in time begins to appear.",
