Nagabharana, who is deemed to be one of the ace directors in Kannada film industry. Music was scored by C. Aswath and Srihari L. Khoday produced the movie.  The film touches one of the most sensitive issues of marital life. In folk style and form, the film throws open a question as to who is the husband â€“ the person who marries an innocent girl and indulges in self pleasures or the person who gives the real and complete experience of life.  G.S.Bhaskar, and his work is a visual thunder in this movie. Especially the night scenes & interior scenes are spellbounded. Bhaskar is a famous technician; he used contrast lighting in this movie, that clearly gave the touch of folk life in every frame.",
