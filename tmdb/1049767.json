Jesus’ disciples and closest friends open their arms to His newest follower, Judas, while learning to live and work with and do two-by-two ministry with one another. Thomas and Ramah’s relationship continues to grow while Simon and Eden discuss how their future family life can coincide with his ministry commitments.",
