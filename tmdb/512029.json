  "overview": "Brenner Pass, Alpine border, spring 2016: the Austrian government announces the construction of a border fence, expecting a shift of the refugee routes to Italy after the Balkan route is closed. The residents fear the fence just as much as the supposedly threatening influx of foreigners to their homeland.  Two years later, the fence is still rolled up in a container, as the inrush of refugees never occurred.",
