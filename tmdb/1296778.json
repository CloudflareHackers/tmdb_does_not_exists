  "overview": "Naomi is a teacher who lives with a younger man named Yuzuru. On the day they met, she found him sitting by the side of the road, alone. Naomi felt that he resembled a thrown-away cat, and decided that she couldn't just leave him there. After that, she moved into a bigger house, taught him to study, and spent her meager salary on expenses for the two of them. There was no physical relationship between the two of them. She had simply taken pity on the poor man and given him a home, and now she would watch over him as he began to mature. At least, that was what she'd thought... But even while Yuzuru's wild ways were a source of frustration to her, she found herself falling for his charms... Sometimes she looks back and wonders what she should've done on the day she met him. She wants to open up to someone, but there's no one to open up to.",
