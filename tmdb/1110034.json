Along with the brutal deaths of two local teenagers, all signs point to the deep fjord; can there be more to the depths than the eye can see? At the bottom of the deepest fjord rests a mythical monster as large as a mountain, with a myriad of arms ready to crush and devour anything they can grab.",
