FBI Agent Royce taps Nina to perform an undercover operation at a modeling agency suspected of using models as couriers when passing government secrets, where an informant worked before being murdered. Nina manages to get a job at the agency, but at first struggles to get along with her new boss, the other models and her FBI contact. After a few shoots, things start to warm up between Nina and the others, and she eventually gets invited to a special \"party\" where an illegal exchange may take place.",
