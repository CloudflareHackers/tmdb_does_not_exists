  "overview": "It's disgusting just to be stared at by a man I hate to death, but to be attacked and raped and messed up... A father-in-law, a brother-in-law, a middle-aged man, a boss... I was unreasonably raped by someone who was physiologically unacceptable to the point of nausea and my mind collapsed! Humiliation, despair, lamentation, dazed... I don't want anyone to know, I can't talk to anyone. Because my body felt it even though my heart was rejecting it. The truth you don't want to turn your eyes away from... A total of 50 corners, 480 minutes, with a focus on first impact.",
