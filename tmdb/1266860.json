  "overview": "An impossible love story that begins outside a movie theater, continues in a café and could end with the two protagonists together… if real life wasn’t much more complicated than the movies. United by their love of cinema, these two main characters decide to live the lives they dreamed of and not the lives they are destined to live. In a series of encounters, imagination triumphs over reality and everyday reality takes a back seat.",
