  "overview": "It's about love, it's about loss, it's about sex. Isolated, a lonely tollbooth operator watches as the world flows past him in a never-ending stream of vehicles, their passengers traveling to and from their lives. They don't give him a second thought, but from their clothes, their hair, their cars, he imagines the kind of world they inhabit.",
