  "overview": "Even now, in times of an ubiquitous sexualisation of everyday life, the female orgasm continues to remain a mystery. In the documentary essay LA PETITE MORT, women of different ages and with different sexual preferences share how they experience orgasms, describe what it feels like and open up about a failed climax. Removed from pornography and excessive eroticism, they open up in indirect conversation with director-narrator Annie Gisler, who illustrates the sensual narratives of her protagonists with poetic, abstract and metaphorical images. Driven by the desire to overcome taboos and expectations that still overshadow female sexuality, the young Swiss filmmaker provides a sensitive and humorous examination of feminine intimacy in all its multifaceted richness. A dialogue among women, for women. And men.",
