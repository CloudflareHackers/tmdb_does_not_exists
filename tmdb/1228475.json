  "overview": "Finist Yasny Sokol is the most famous hero of Belogorye, the strongest, most dexterous and most deserved. Well, the most beautiful, of course. All other heroes are equal to him, children want to be like him, and girls just look at him. Finist is a real superstar. And he carefully protects and maintains this status of his. He needs more and more feats, he is simply obsessed with them. But there is a nuance. The practical benefit of the feat for Finist is no longer of decisive importance. Let's say, freeing a village from a herd of wild boars that tramples down crops is boring, uninteresting, futile: they won't gossip about it, they won't admire it. But going to the end of the world, where Beauty is imprisoned in a tower, guarded by an unimaginable Beast, is a challenge.",
