  "overview": "Every year, fifty teenage boys meet for an event known throughout the country as \"The Long Walk.\" Among this year's chosen crop is sixteen-year-old Ray Garraty. He knows the rules: that warnings are issued if you fall under speed, stumble, sit down. That after three warnings... you get your ticket. And what happens then serves as a chilling reminder that there can be only one winner in the Walk. The one that survives.",
