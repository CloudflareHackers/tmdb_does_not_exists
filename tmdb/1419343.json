  "overview": "In the Mang community, the day after a Giran (eclipse) concludes with a unique tradition. A newlywed girl bathes at sunrise, visits a prominent villager's house, and donates as part of a ritual. Villagers, in turn, give her stale food and clothes, believing that such donations transfer their crises to the Mang society, ensuring the village's well-being.  This practice is depicted in the story of Guna, an eight-year-old girl raised by her uncle after losing her parents. Married into the household of Babu Manga, her husband, Santaya, is an addict.",
