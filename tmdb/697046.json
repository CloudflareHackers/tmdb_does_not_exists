One day, this routine is disrupted as a curious  young girl enters her garden unexpectedly. Cynthia  is besotted by the girlsâ€™ grace, youth and beauty and in her  deranged, intoxicated state, decides to kidnap her using the  chloroform that she uses on her butterflies, and on herself  recreationally.",
