  "overview": "Director Andy Zane presents an in-depth look into the industry's most influential performers' thoughts on a range of topics. Chanel Preston, Prince Yahshua, and others discuss pornography's unintended role as sex education, performance in front of the camera versus real-life and what really turns them on. Of course, they put words into action with plenty of the passionate and wild sex that Pornfidelity.com is know for.\"",
