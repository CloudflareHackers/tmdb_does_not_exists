  "overview": "Jo Jo is an Edinburgh Goodfella with a sharp mind and a cavalier attitude to law. In the bleak, edgy climate of the 1980's Jo Jo is seen by many on the estate as a hero; out-manoeuvring the police while supporting his close-knit family. What is it that draws the charming and confident Jo Jo to Lorraine, a vulnerable woman obsessed by Marilyn Monroe? What figure from his past is fuelling his fantasies and driving him towards darker crimes and the quicksand of heroin? Can Jo Jo look after himself when he doesn't know who he is?",
