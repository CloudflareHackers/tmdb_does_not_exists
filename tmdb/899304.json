  "overview": "The tale of Hillary Hampton, a beautiful heiress who inherits a Nevada brothel from her late husband. She's horrified to learn that her husband's sole means of income was derived from the 'world's oldest profession.' However, the brothel's employees soon talk Hillary into running the place herself. The reluctant heiress agrees but on her terms, turning the club into multi-purpose pleasure emporium that offers legal advice, tax preparation, legal aid, and, of course, plenty of wild sex!",
