  "overview": "Thirteen-year-old Bastien is the center of a reconstructed family: six half-brothers and sisters, eight \"parents,\" and as many houses. His tasks within the family are far more complex than what he has to do at school. But enough's enough: the children decide to wage a revolution and turn the rules upside down. All together, they squat a large apartment and now it'll be up to the parents to come to them!",
