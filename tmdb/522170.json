  "overview": "A new look at the poem, \"Christabel\" (1816), by the British S. T. Coleridge. The only daughter of a rural worker, Christabel meets Geraldine, a mysterious woman who claims to have been attacked by men and needs help. In her innocence and purity, Christabel welcomes Geraldine into her father's house. From then on, the two protagonists relate in a way that Geraldine has a great influence on Christabel, destabilizing her convictions and promoting rupture of the traditions, but that bring a feeling of passion and freedom never experienced by her. In this adaptation, instead of England, the history takes place in the rural zone, in the middle of the closed Goian; The character Geraldine is a mysterious, free and independent woman who appears to swing the established structure and pre-framed relationships, which weigh on Christabel and her father.",
