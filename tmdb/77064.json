  "overview": "Brewster seems to be an almost too perfect example of idyllic small-town America, with everyone living in peace and harmony. So when newcomer Whiley Pritcher starts up his own local cable TV show with the question \"what's wrong with Brewster?\", there surely can't be any deep dark secrets in the town that are just waiting to come to the surface - or can there? And when the question becomes \"who's wrong with Brewster?\" things start getting seriously nasty.",
