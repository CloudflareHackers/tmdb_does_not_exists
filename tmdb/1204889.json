  "overview": "Ok-ja and her son Do-hyun falsely register in Daechi-dong, Seoul, for better schooling despite her limited finances. Do-hyun, envious of his wealthy schoolmate Sang-su for receiving disability benefits, learns that he isn't actually disabled, exposing flaws in government benefits. At university, he and his new friend Ji-woo manipulate government policies for entrepreneurial subsidies, intentionally failing to exploit government leniency. Seeking greater wealth, he embarks on a dubious cryptocurrency venture with investor Kevin, sidelining Ji-woo and enjoying brief success before their scheme crumbles due to regulatory scrutiny. They literally try to make bigger money with bigger money, but end up creating a Death Business.",
