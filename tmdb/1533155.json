  "overview": "Mulholland Dr. (1999) was originally conceived as a pilot for a TV series, filmed in 1999. It was rejected by the network (ABC) and never aired. It was essentially the first half of the film Mulholland Drive (2001), and Lynch added new footage and an ending to create the movie.  Yearning to spread her wings and make a name for herself in the cut-throat world of Hollywood's film industry, instead, the bright-eyed actress, Betty, has a chance encounter with the amnesiac and alluringly mysterious brunette, Rita. Having survived a terrible car accident, Rita struggles to piece together the fragmented memories of what happened just before the incident, to find out who she is; however, this is easier said than done. Now, Betty and Rita embark on a mission to unearth clues scattered all over Hollywood. Is there a shocking truth hiding in plain sight on the winding Mulholland Drive?",
