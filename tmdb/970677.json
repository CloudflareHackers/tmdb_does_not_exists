  "overview": "A life of books. Reading. Correcting. Editing. Then doing it all over again. It's an arduous, thankless job. And the deadlines! They just get shorter and shorter. Do a good job, and just get less time to do the next one. With a schedule like that you've got to do something to blow off some steam. And since Stephanie's got the most wicked imagination imaginable, she chooses to be the centerpiece of her very nasty fantasies.",
