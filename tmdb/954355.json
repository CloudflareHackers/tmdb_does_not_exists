Seung-a is dissatisfied with her husband Chan-jun, who seems to have lost energy compared to before marriage. Then one day, Seung-ah, who was alone with Dong-jun, seduced Dong-jun and had sex. Dong-Jun hears Seung-Ah's concerns that he has had less sex with Chan-Jun, and advises him not to rush and act cautiously. Seung-ah Chan-jun, who greets Chan-joon in a different outfit that night, is embarrassed by the change in Seung-ah's appearance.",
