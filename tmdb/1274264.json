  "overview": "A sensual drama that depicts the relationship between a female teacher with a special sexual fetish and a student with whom she has a deep connection. This is the debut work of director Toshiya Konami, who also directed Hideo Josada. Starring Iori Furukawa, an accomplished actor, this is an ambitious work that distinguishes itself from the standard tutor movie by focusing on the perspective of the main character who faces a dilemma. Nozomi (Iori Furukawa), who was forced out of her teaching job for some reason, is on her way to visit her mother's grave in her hometown when she reunites with her beloved teacher Yoshihiko (Yota Kawase), who had remarried her classmate Sanae (Riri Kuribayashi). I decide to work as a live-in tutor for his stepchild, Atsushi (Yuya Kaneko).",
