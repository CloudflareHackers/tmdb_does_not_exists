  "overview": "Seon-kyeon lives and works in a secluded and isolated guesthouse, where he rarely sees any guests except for visits from his girlfriend Yoo-min, who comes to play. One day, something suspicious and strange starts happening in this lonely pension. A pair of male and female virgin ghosts, a twin who lived in the house and both of whom died without ever experiencing sex, declare war on the couple by possessing their bodies. They have one wish: to be satisfied with an excess of sex to resolve the bitterness of their deaths, so they can finally leave the house without any regrets. To fulfill this, Seon-kyeon endures extreme, intense sex with the female ghost, burning with passion day and night. On the other hand, Yoo-min starts losing her mind after a physical encounter with the male ghost and tells her boyfriend that they should leave, but he is already ensnared by the female ghost's lustful possession.",
