  "overview": "Marika, a housewife, is presented with a creature called \"Bero\" that looks like a sea squirt from her husband Hiroki, who has decided to leave his family behind in Oman in the Middle East . Her husband tells her to pet \"Bello\" instead of him .  When I start working alone, my sister Yuika visits my house with her boyfriend. My sister, whom I met for the first time in five years, quit the pachinko parlor with him and consulted with her brother-in-law, Yuki. He came to be troublesome for a while. Marika, who doesn't listen to her story, gives a dubious expression, but she eats the meal deliciously and allows the slapstick but friendly two to spend only one night. In the middle of the night, she receives an international call from her husband. When she asks why she didn't talk to him about Yuika, Yuki says, \"You must be an only child.\"",
