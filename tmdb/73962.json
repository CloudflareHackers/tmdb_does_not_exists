  "overview": "Sang-Woo is a HIV positive 38-year-old man who lives in a small shed with his mother. His mother at the age of 60 began working as a prostitute to support herself and her son out of their small shed. Meanwhile, Sang-Woo works as her pimp - collecting payment and arranging appointments with his cellphone. Their clients include a paraplegic man and soldiers on holiday. Living through their difficult situation, Sang-Woo still carries a strong bond with his mother. Sang-Woo also harbors intense anger within. His father abandoned them and then remarried into a seemingly normal family. But actually, his father married a woman who is a religious fanatic and their son always locks himself away in his room. Sang- Woo often meets their daughter (his step-sister) for drinks outside of a Buddhist temple. Can Sang-Woo ever find a way out for himself and his mother?",
