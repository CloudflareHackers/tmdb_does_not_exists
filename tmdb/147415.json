  "overview": "On the outskirts of Parisian council housing estates lies a vast wasteland that still retains its mysteries in this day and age, and serves as a refuge for people who, in their spare time, escape or are often ejected from their overcrowded dwellings. They form small, rather harmless bands, share their first secrets, build up their \"treasures\" and submit to strict rituals. The sanctity of their rebellions is underscored by initiation through blindfolded jumping and a blood test. An impossible love story is born between two members of the same clan, Dan, a beautiful, tomboyish girl, and Lucky, a sweet but feisty boy.",
