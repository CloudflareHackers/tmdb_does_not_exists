  "overview": "Naamkaran is a hindi word and it means The Naming and used in context of naming a child. Naamkaran tells the story of two sisters â€“ one a pickpocket and the other a teacher by profession. Shot in Kolkata in winter, it follows the journey of the two sisters as their worlds collide to make ends meet. The teacher is looking for a good name for her son. She rejects names suggested by her pickpocket sister and ill father. It is interesting to see how she finalizes the name of her kid. Sen Sharma handles the quirky subject with a degree of authority, choosing not to dwell on drama and allowing events to narrate the story.",
