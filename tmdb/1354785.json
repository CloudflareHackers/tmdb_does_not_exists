  "overview": "Jay is a ten, but he also happens to be a narcissist. That’s why Son blocks him on every platform after spending one date with him… Only for them to bump into each other again two years later.  It all begins with Son’s sweet tooth and his dessert ASMR channel which leads to none other than some serious dental problems. Seeking help, Son walks right into Jay’s path, who is a dentistry student. If that is no coincidence enough, Jay also just starts working night shifts at the convenience store in Son’s apartment building. At this point, even if Son wants to run, he doesn’t have much chance of escaping. Even two years later, Jay is still consistently a narcissist, but Son is thinking of giving this love another go, because maybe, just maybe, this time it will work out.",
