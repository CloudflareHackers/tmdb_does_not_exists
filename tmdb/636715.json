  "overview": "A breezy, hilarious special by one of India's top comedians (he wrote this himself) where he talks about his greatest fear - turning into a typical Indian uncle. Filmed in a comedy club in Mumbai, the show has everything you'd expect from live stand up - plenty of thoughts that are of no use to humankind. If you have an hour to waste, this is a good way to do it.",
