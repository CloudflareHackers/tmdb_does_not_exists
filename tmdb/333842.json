  "overview": "Ben is delighted when he rips open his present and finds a penguin inside. “Hello, Penguin!” says Ben. Penguin says nothing. Ben tickles Penguin; he pulls his funniest face; he puts on a happy hat, sings a silly song and does a dizzy dance. “Can’t you talk?” says Ben. Penguin says nothing. It isn’t until a passing lion intervenes that Penguin finally speaks ... and when he does, Ben discovers something that was really worth the wait.",
