  "overview": "In the late 70s, four teen boys go on a road trip to discover their sexuality and get their rocks off at the fictional Kitty Ranch Brothel. A classic rite of passage romp, right? But the real story lies in the struggles of our main character, Randy, and his sexual confusion in a time before that was chic or even spoken of, other than high school locker room insults of \"fag.\" Fortunately, our hero's fruitless quest to prove his heterosexuality leads, in the end, to something quite the opposite.",
