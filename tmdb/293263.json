  "overview": "Devika (Ritu Varma) is a gentle and grounded music teacher at a local school. She gets engaged to Jaggu (Subbaraju), a possessive man whose controlling behaviour quietly concerns those around her. When a priest predicts that Devika might fall for someone else before her marriage, her family dismisses it. But soon, a mysterious man named Danny (Surya Vashistta) enters her life, and things begin to shift in unexpected ways. Who is Danny? Why has he appeared? What role does Durga play in all this? And what happens to Devikaâ€™s engagement? These questions form the core of the story.",
