  "overview": "Disillusioned with the Los Angeles dating scene, but obsessed with meeting her soul mate, upcoming jingle copywriter Zoe (Jessica Drake) hesitantly follows up on an Internet ad her colleague, Becky (August), encourages her to answer. It's from an eccentric and witty girl named Moonbeam (Dana DeArmond). Although Zoe isn't a lesbian and has never entertained the idea of a lesbian tryst, much less a lesbian relationship, she easily falls in love with the girl's personality and companionship. But as the relationship grows, she worries that actually consummating it with sex. . . might not be as easy, if even possible. Will she find kissing girls as easy as falling in love?",
