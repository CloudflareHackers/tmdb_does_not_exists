  "overview": "The Chronicles of the 4.5 Gang is a 2025 Malayalam crime comedy series created by Krishand, streaming on SonyLIV. Set in Thiruvananthapuram, it follows five childhood friends from the slums—Arikuttan, Kanji, Maniyan, Althaf, and Moonga—who rise from petty hustles in milk and flower markets to build a feared gang, blurring lines between survival and ambition. The story unfolds through flashbacks as Arikuttan hires a ghostwriter to shape their violent past into a respectable biography, making the narration intentionally unreliable. Mixing gritty gangster drama with absurd humor, stylized storytelling, and social commentary, the series has been praised as one of the most inventive Malayalam web shows to date.",
