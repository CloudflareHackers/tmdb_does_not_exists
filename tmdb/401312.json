  "overview": "“Just married” is the story of a guy who suffers from physical relationship related anxiety. He was some type of a Romeo before getting married to the girl of his dreams. But then again he and his wife do not have the best physical relationship yet, when the man feels romantic he goes to the bed and sees his wife is sleeping. He also has someone in his life that is only there for giving useless advises. You can guess now that these kinds of situations create a lot of hilarious situations in the movie. Just married is a comedy for adult audiences, but there is absolutely no vulgarity in the movie.",
