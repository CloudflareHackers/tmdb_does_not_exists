  "overview": "In 1996, five overworked Yale undergrads formed a club to watch porno films on weekends while ingesting mass quantities of fried chicken and Miller High Life. As the \"Porn 'n' Chicken Club\" gained members and notoriety, the hide-bound Yale Establishment ordered that the club be closed down. Defiantly, the original members scraped together enough money to produce their own X-rated movie â€“ and much to the dismay of the faculty and administration, the club became more popular and renowned than ever.",
