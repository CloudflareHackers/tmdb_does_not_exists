  "overview": "It's 1973, the scene is New York, there's a strange virus, a penis transplant, a saw and a stick of leeks: Adam is not successful with women and has a rather tiny penis, but his friend Dick is a very successful lover, owning \"the largest cock in town\". When Dick suddenly dies of the virus, Adam sees his chance for a better genital area. But does the shady Dr. Cockburn really know what he's doing? Why does poor Adam change into a sex maniac? Originally a stage play by Jörg Buttgereit, has this been photographed for the screen by Thilo Gosejohann, formally based on a radio play by Jörg Buttgereit.",
