At one point, Shingo's women's magazine featured \"Open Marriage,\" a new marriage style for married couples. \"Open marriage\", which was advocated in the 1970s, was that if there was mutual agreement, we could freely have a relationship with other opposite sex. Shingo, who was requested by the editor-in-chief for an experience report, managed to persuade Ayaka ... After that, the two who found each other's sexual partners, with the excitement born from jealousy, disappeared from sexlessness and began to demand each other's bodies violently.",
