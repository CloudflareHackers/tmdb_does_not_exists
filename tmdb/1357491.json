  "overview": "'Silicon Valley' links three sites in California's Santa Clara valley; the threadbare visitor centre of Nasa's Ames research facility; the better maintained but privately owned 'Intel Museum'; and the Winchester Mystery House - a haunted mansion built by the guilt-ridden widow of riffle maker. These locations are linked through a circular motif which morphs between globe, disk, and scrying ball as its shape is noticed and captured by Keogh's iPhone SE.",
