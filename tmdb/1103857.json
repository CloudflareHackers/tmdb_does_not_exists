  "overview": "Set in 1301 at the end of Medieval times, our most famous star-crossed lovers turn the tides on the history Shakespeare based his own story on, as they reveal the truth to the very future of the Empire. But the biggest twist in this most beloved of tales, is leaving the poetry of Iambic Pentameter in the past, for the original pop music that rockets these ever-present themes right to the heart of our characters in the most surprising, and perhaps most powerful way that has ever been seen, or heard, before... The greatest love story of all time, set to the greatest music of our time.",
