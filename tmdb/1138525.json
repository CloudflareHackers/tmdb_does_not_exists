  "overview": "The story begins with a village lawyer named Joyram Mukherjee, a person of moderate income who had bought an elephant to respond to the arrogance of a a big zamindar family of that  locality. Joyram was the legal advisor of the zamindar’s late father and had saved him from many critical situations. He had requested the Zamindar to send an elephant for the joy ride on his daughter’s marriage. Joyram was under the impression that the zamindar won’t refuse such a humble request of a friend of his late father. However, the zamindar's wife rudely refused Joyram’s request. The old man felt insulted at this behavior and became so adamant that he  bought an elephant with all the money that  he had saved for the future of his family.  Soon, thereafter the young elephant became a part of his family and Joyram started to treat her like his own daughter. He named her ‘Aador’, in Bengali which means ‘The Dearest’.",
