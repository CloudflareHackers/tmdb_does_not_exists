  "overview": "Victoria is a beautiful, young woman just beginning to succeed in L.A. as a jewelry designer. Then she meets Jack, a handsome and enormously rich entrepreneur... and her life changes forever. He courts her with a combination of charm and sensuality that she finds irresistible. Everything is better and more intense than she has ever experienced - the romance, the sex, the orgasms, everything. No matter what he asks, she will do it to please him. She doesn't see herself as a victim. She is a willing co-conspirator. He continues to push the erotic envelope further and further, plunging Victoria into a world of sexuality that she never dreamed existed. Finally, it gets too much for her and that begins a dark, downward spiral that almost costs Victoria her sanity and her life. She is able to escape by the skin of her teeth and then decides to tell her story as a cautionary tale for other women who may face this same kind of thrilling but dangerous total sexual possession.",
