  "overview": "A woman alone dressed in leather carrying a whip. Spiked heel boots echo as she walks through an empty hallway, searching. . . wondering. Is she dreaming? She finds herself in an abandoned building. Is she really alone? As she walks through the dark corridors, her fantasies of strange and exotic forms take shape. The touch of leather, velvet, silk... and skin on skin.",
