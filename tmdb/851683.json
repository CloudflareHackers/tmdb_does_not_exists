  "overview": "Diogo and Emília have been together for 16 years. They have a teenage daughter and undergo a tedious phase. However, everything turns upside down when they find out their best friends, Ricardo and Bettina, have an open marriage. More than that: they are swingers, are super cool about this choice, and try to convince the other couple that it is possible to be quite happy with this liberal lifestyle. This news comes like a bolt from the blue. After reacting badly to the idea, Emília gets excited and convinces Diogo to, at least, go to a party with Ricardo and Betina's \"gang\". And that is when a series of events that will shake the couple's boring little life starts. Will they set their jealousy aside and become supporters of this practice?",
