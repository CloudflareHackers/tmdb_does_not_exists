  "overview": "13th tells the story of Ritesh, a successful venture capitalist who reunites with his maverick IIT-JEE mentor, Mohit Tyagi Sir, to help scale his visionary educational institute. The series unfolds against the backdrop of India's most gruelling academic competition and a startup culture fixated on valuations. At its heart, 13th is a deeply nostalgic, human story of a master and his pupil-bound by ambition, respect, and the lessons that shape a lifetime.",
