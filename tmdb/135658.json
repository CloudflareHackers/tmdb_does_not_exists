  "overview": "Two 19 year old girls were brutally murdered. The bodies were abandoned and could not be found anywhere inside the warehouse scattered with blood. The only suspect, was their friend. He was drunk on the night of the incident. He doesn’t recall a single memory. No memories of committing a murder. No memories of not committing a murder either. The boy had become a young adult by the time he was released from prison in 11 years. He wished to pursue a quiet life… But another murder flips the village. A white bone carcass has been discovered. The real devil is hiding somewhere within the seemingly peaceful village. Who’s the real devil?",
