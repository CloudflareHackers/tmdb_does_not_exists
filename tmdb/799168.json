  "overview": "\"One evening, without any particular expectations, I went to the Lavanderia a Vapore theatre in Collegno, headquarters of the Balletto Teatro di Torino, directed by Loredana Furno, and I saw Sexxx, the ballet by Matteo Levaggi. I’m not a fan of modern dance, but I think this is why my fascination that evening was sincere and convinced. Above all, I was struck by the way the choreographer was able to take the explicit gestures and movements of sexual communication and transform them into the language of dance. And since body language is one of the topics I have been interested in filming since that ‘scandalous’ Guardami, I was already sufficiently motivated to transform the ballet into a movie.\" - Davide Ferrario",
