  "overview": "The original 1922 \"Nosferatu\" is regarded as one of the most important films ever made, and a cornerstone of the vampire genre. Now, over one hundred years later, the bloodthirsty Count Orlok rises once again to cast an unearthly shadow in a feature-length retelling of the classic horror masterpiece. Faithfully presented in the style of golden-age horror, and combining scenic elements from the original film with new sound and music, this all new \"Nosferatu\" is a never-before-seen 'cinematic remix' of the timeless vampire tale, and an otherworldly revisit to the land of ghosts and phantoms where blood is life!",
