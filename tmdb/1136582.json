  "overview": "Clara and Brighten (Cadence Lux and Hazel Moore), two members of a conservative rural family, are having dinner when Brighten kicks Clara under the table, whispering that she needs to speak with her privately once their parents leave for errands later. Clara quietly agrees though she's perplexed as to what Brighten could need so urgently. Clara is shocked when Brighten invites Elijah (Seth Gamble), her boyfriend, inside. Brighten explains that they are having trouble staying chaste until marriage. Brighten mentions that they believe they have found a solution to their predicament: SOAKING. Soaking involves a man inserting his penis in a woman's vagina and not moving it. The only thing is that there needs to be a third party present to physically move the other two so that they can achieve sexual gratification.",
