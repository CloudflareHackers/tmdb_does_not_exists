  "overview": "In a 30-minute workshop talk, actress Iris Berben remembers her early leading role in the German film \"Supergirl - Das Mädchen von den Sternen\" (1971) by director Rudolf Thome in detail. \"When I saw the movie again, it sent me on a wonderful journey,\" recalls the actress. It was a journey back to her beginnings. \"It's a wonderful coincidence that young German film also began at this time.\" For Iris Berben, the re-watching of \"Supergirl\" became a melancholy look back, in which she observed herself as a young actress in the role of the mysterious alien Francesca Farnese as well as seeing all her colleagues again, including above all Marquard Bohm (1941-2006), this \"wonderful madman\", with whom she had already played in her first feature film \"Detektive\" (1969), also directed by Rudolf Thome.",
