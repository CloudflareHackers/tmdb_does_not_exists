Everything would be just fine were it not for Tatiana’s ex-boyfriend, Oleg, who comes to the village looking for her. Tatiana is forced to tell Maxim the whole truth about herself. She tells him about the robbery she committed together with Oleg and how she took all the blame on herself and then escaped from prison. Maxim assures her that he will be by her side no matter what and will help her get through all this. But things are not as simple as they seem, because Maxim isn’t who he pretends to be.",
