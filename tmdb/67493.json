  "overview": "Andie is undateable– thanks to her older brother Alec, the most popular guy in high school, who makes sure no guy comes near her. Fortunately, Andie has her three best friends to help her shake the little sister stigma: Dakota, the gay best friend who is more than confident in his own sexuality; Imogen the innocent, fresh-out-of-home-school wallflower; and Courtney, Alec’s girlfriend and last year’s homecoming queen, who can’t let go of her high school days. These four very different personalities help each other navigate the hormone-induced, angst-filled sea of high school.",
