Then the latter tells him that he should not follow her until she calls him. In order to grab her attention, he sends his father (Chandramohan) and mother (Pragati) to express his love and let her know that they too encourage him instead of trying to divert his attention from love. Later Nandu realises that she too is truly loving him. At this juncture, Jayaprakash Reddy (Jayaprakash Reddy) goes to Peddi Reddy for an alliance for his brother's son Veera Pratap Reddy (Saleem Panda).
