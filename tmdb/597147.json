  "overview": "â€˜Vastraharan':A play within a play, Vastraharan is about a group of actors attempting to stage the vastraharan episode from the Mahabharata. It begins with the performers rehersing on the day of the show. One disaster follows another and it soon turns into a farcical situation. However, the play does ultimately get staged and how! However, there are no surprises in store in the play. It would not be untrue to say that half-an-hour into the play and one knew what to expect. Like a well-oiled machine, not surprising considering they have done more than 3,500 shows, the play unfolds rapidly and takes us into the middle of the action without any waste of time. One farcical situation is followed by another making for very hilarious viewing. There was nothing",
