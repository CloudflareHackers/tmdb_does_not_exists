  "overview": "A series of murders leads Agent Vanessa Mann (Blake Blossom) to a small town, where she’s paired up with local sheriff Woodrow Green (Isiah Maxwell). While the hot desert air only thickens the tension between the new partners, suspicions arise when they pick up hitchhiking couple Mickey and Jack (Kylie Rocket and Victor Ray). Another curveball is thrown their way when their car breaks down and they’re forced to be towed by garage owner Angel (Charlotte Sins). With a killer still on the loose, an ensuing night of sexual excess and a series of double crosses will test just how far these officers are willing to go to crack the case.",
