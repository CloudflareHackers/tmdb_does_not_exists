  "overview": "A cloudy riverbank. Kazuko, a one-piece woman with a floral pattern, stands under the viaduct. She was abandoned here when she was young and raised by a homeless man who lives there.  Yoshio offers an engagement ring to his girlfriend Sachiko, but he gets confused. As he was frustrated and walking along the night road, Kazuko, who was standing under the guard and selling his body, called out and headed for a love hotel with her. Kazuko accepts rough acts as they are. After the fact, Yoshio opened the ring case in front of Kazuko and showed it. She couldn't help feeling destined because she never thought that such a day would come.  A few days later, Yoshio also visited the riverside village, and Kazuko said goodbye to the homeless man. Kazuko was greeted by Yoshio's parents, Takeshi and Yoko, with joy and tension in her heart. Even though she knew her poor upbringing, her parents kindly accepted her because she wouldn't hide it from her family.",
