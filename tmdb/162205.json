  "overview": "This glossy romp serves up a plot that's not so much a sequel to the original, but a retelling of it with an all-new cast. Once again we get a bunch of bodaciously beautiful models setting out for fun in the countryside in a rented RV. As before, the gals waste no time in breaking down and getting into all sorts of sexy entanglements with the locals. When the hayseed sheriff finds out what thee shapely sirens have been doing with his citizens, he sets out to put them all behind bars. Luckily for the gals, deputy Ron Jeremy has a soft spot for them and double-crosses his bitter boss. The whole thing is silly, but face-paced and steamy enough to satisfy.",
