  "overview": "A parody of the big-budget Ridley Scott-helmed sword-and-sandal epic, Gladiator Eroticvs stars Darian Caine as a fierce Roman soldier who's sold into slavery and forced to fight in the lesbian games (well, maybe \"forced\" isn't quite the right word). Also starring John Fedele as the Emperor Dickus Minimus and Factory 2000 regular Misty Mundae as his royal sister, Clitorus, Gladiator Eroticvs offers the same thrills, excitement, slapstick comedy, and girl-on-girl action that you've come to expect from a Seduction Cinema production.",
