  "overview": "In the snowy Giant Mountains at the end of the German occupation, a group of child heroes rescue a downed French pilot. Their actions resemble the principle of the well-known 'telephone game' – the pilot is passed between mountain villages like a secret message – secret delivery – at school. But the children play a highly risky game. They are confronted by deadly soldiers of the occupying army, they must outwit traitors and informers and, last but not least, survive in the harsh conditions of winter in the mountains.",
