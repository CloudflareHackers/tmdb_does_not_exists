  "overview": "'Hall of Fame adult film creator Michael Zen combined a chilling, supernaturally-tinged screenplay, an all-star cast, exotic locations, and, of course, plenty of sexually-charged sexual situations to make this a modern classic featuring Serenity as a tempestuous witch whose mysterious powers can transcend the barriers of matter, energy, space and time. Serenity's incendiary performance earned an AVN nomination for Best Actress. Her charismatic co-stars included Chris Cannon, Jewel De'nyle, Kylie Ireland, Gwen Summers, and Lee Stone.'  Join Wicked girl Serenity and award-winning director Michael Zen for an epic tale of love and lust that breaks the very barriers of time. From the witch hunts of America's puritan past to the free-spirited sexual freedoms of today, Serenity elevates screen sex to the level of erotic art in one of the biggest films of her career.",
