Transfer student, Ryuko Matoi, arrives on campus carrying a giant sword, that is actually half of a scissor. She is looking for the woman who holds the other half of her sword who killed her father. It is said that Satsuki Kiryuin knows the identity of the killer but when Ryuko confronts her she is beaten by the student council and their powerful \"Goku Uniforms\" whom she cannot match in strength. However, once Ryuko receives her own \"Kamui\" by the name of Senketsu, the odds are lifted in her favor.",
