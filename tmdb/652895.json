  "overview": "In a small beach town in Bangladesh, fearless Ayesha confronts social prohibition and violent opposition from her poverty-ridden family to surf. Like few other youngsters, she and her best friend Sohel are trained by self-made Bangladeshi surfer, Amir. As this unusual surfing enthusiasm gets international attention from surfing community and documentary filmmakers, fund money generates jealousy, squabbles, and power tussles. While surfing brings newfound fame and glory to Sohel, it is the 'prohibited' love for surfing that brings forced marriage and a life of misery for Ayesha. After seeking an extravagant, reckless lifestyle in the capital city, derailed Sohel returns back to Cox's Bazar, where their passion for surfing reunites them and unleashes a new hope for surfing in the small beach town.",
